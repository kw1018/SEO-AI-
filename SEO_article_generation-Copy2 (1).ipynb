The Highway Series is clearly aimed at players who are hybrid curious but want something more along the lines of a traditional acoustic than Fender’s groundbreaking, yet polarizing, Acoustasonic Series.\\nHighway Series guitars are thinline acoustics featuring a specially designed Fishman Fluence Acoustic magnetic soundhole pickup. They promise electric playability with acoustic tone via a more straightforward and streamlined system than the DSP-driven Acoustasonic, at a nicer price point and with a more conventional aesthetic.\\nThe Highway Series consists of two models, Parlor and Dreadnought, each available in mahogany or mahogany with a solid Sitka spruce top. Our review units were an all-mahogany Dreadnought and a spruce-topped Parlor.\\nAll Highway Series guitars have the iconic Fender six-in-line headstock design, and a more traditional look from the neck down. A Fishman Fluence Acoustic pickup is stealthily tucked up near the top of the neck, with a curve that follows the lip of the soundhole. The volume and tone knobs are the only other obvious indication of a hybrid design.\\nTo my eyes, the all-mahogany Dreadnought appeared almost too plain, while the natural spruce top with checkered rosette and top binding brightened up and nicely highlighted the Parlor.\\nInterestingly, there’s no indication of the Highway Series or a model designation anywhere. The headstock simply has the Fender logo etched into the wood. A plaque on the back indicates an origin of Ensenada, Mexico. Craftsmanship on both guitars was smooth and blemish free, which is especially impressive given the price of about a grand.\\n\\nThe Fluence Acoustic magnetic pickup uses analog technology to deliver pure amplified tone (Image credit: Fender)\\nBoth instruments feel comfortable, with beveled arm rests and contoured backs. The fully chambered bodies measure a mere 2.25 inches deep, just slightly thicker than a typical solidbody Strat. For that matter, the bolt-on C-shaped neck measures a mere 1.69 inches wide at the nut and feels more like an electric, even if the frets are narrower and taller than the jumbo frets often found on a Strat.\\nThe Parlor and the Dreadnought are lightweight and ergonomic, and that’s especially awesome when playing standing up.\\nGetting the slightly lower action I prefer was easily achieved with a quick turn of the truss rod via the included hex wrench. The extra-light phosphor-bronze strings deliver an acoustic feel to the otherwise electric-like situation. Fender nailed the best-of-both-worlds target on both instruments.\\nThe playability is wonderfully easy, yet still authentically acoustic enough to feel appropriate for fingerpicking as well as plectrum playing. True to their body styles, the Dreadnought is a natural strummer, while the Parlor is more organically suited to fingerpicking.\\n\\nFishman designed the Fluence Acoustic pickup specifically to give the Fender Highway Series a uniquely natural acoustic electric signal, and they hit the bull’s-eye (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe Highway Series exists in its own lane sonically. These guitars aren’t going to win any campfire competitions, but they do deliver enough acoustic oomph to work well in a van, a hotel room or backstage, and they are significantly more full and natural sounding than an Acoustasonic.\\nBoth feature a tapered floating X bracing pattern that seems to bring out plenty of top resonance. Obviously, the Dreadnought, with its bigger body, delivers more boom than the Parlor, and in the case of our review units, the mahogany top on the Dreadnought gave it a balmier wooden quality, while the spruce-top Parlor had more articulation.\\nPrimarily designed to be plugged in, both guitars came into their own when coupled with amplification. They sounded remarkably large even when run through the 100-watt Fender Acoustic Junior GO, with its eight-inch woofer, and then went up to a whole other level when run through the Acoustasonic setting on the new Tone Master Pro coupled with the 1,000-watt Fender FR-12 powered 1x12 cabinet. Talk about a huge acoustic stage sound! I was able to crank up with zero feedback.\\nFishman designed the Fluence Acoustic pickup specifically to give the Fender Highway Series a uniquely natural acoustic-electric signal, and they hit the bull’s-eye. These magnetic pickups have none of the quackiness associated with traditional piezo undersaddle pickups, and they don’t suffer from the somewhat dull, midrange focus associated with most magnetic soundhole designs.\\n\\nThe binding is especially pretty on the paler, two-tone Parlor (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe tone is beefy in the bottom and balanced in the middle, with a nice top-end sparkle. The curved pickup is located up near the top of the neck, so the sound certainly has the throatiness of a neck pickup.\\nIf you feel the tone has too much junk in the trunk, you can roll it back via the contour knob from the full-boded sound of Voice 1 to the tighter, more mid- and top-focused Voice 2, for more clarity and articulation that sits better in a band mix.\\nThe only thing I found missing was a strong sense of percussiveness from the top, the kind that the middle position on the Acoustasonic Series delivers in spades. It would be cool if Fender and Fishman could incorporate that into future designs, and I’ll bet they will.\\nThe bottom line is that the Highway Series is an excellent crossover option for players who want a killer acoustic stage sound from an instrument with the comfort and playability of an electric guitar.\\n\\nThe stylish volume and tone knobs are identically placed on both models (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe aesthetic is still traditional enough that most onlookers wouldn’t think to look twice, yet it has enough of a modern hybrid vibe that folks who have any musical sense will likely do a double take.\\nWhether you choose the Dreadnought or Parlor is a matter of personal preference. Whichever you select, both instruments deliver excellent playability and tone.\\nYou’re not supposed to be able to conjure an authentic acoustic sound from such thin bodies, but Fender and Fishman have found an analog way forward, free from the worries of digital component durability.\\nFor continuing to break new ground while maintaining mass appeal and attainability, both Highway Series guitars earn an Editors’ Pick Award.\\nSpecifications (Dreadnought)\\n\\nNUT WIDTH 1.69”, Tush\\xa0\\nNECK Mahogany, 12” radius\\xa0\\nFRETBOARD Indian rosewood, 25.5” scale\\xa0\\nFRETS 20, narrow tall\\xa0\\nTUNERS Fender ClassicGear\\xa0\\nBODY Thinline tapered dreadnought.

[Real Customer Ratings]\\n\\nFender, one of the most recognizable brands in guitars, enjoys an enviable reputation for its iconic range of electric guitars and amplifiers. But, how do guitarists feel about their acoustic models?\\nFender acoustic guitars are good for beginners and compare favorably to guitars of a similarly affordable price from brands such as Yamaha, Cort, and Alvarez. Unlike their range of electric guitars, Fender acoustic guitars are affordably priced due to being manufactured offshore, with the exception of their Acoustisonic series being made entirely in the US.\\nBut, don’t just take my word for it.\\nIn the following article, we’re going to take a closer look at Fender’s acoustic guitar range, and how customers who have bought their guitars genuinely feel about them.\\nWe’ve collected customer ratings from Amazon, Sweetwater, Guitar Center, Musicians Friend, and Reverb.com\\xa0and compiled an average customer rating for each popular model Fender offers.\\nSo, if you’re looking for a completely unbiased opinion on Fender acoustic guitars, stay tuned!\\xa0But first…\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWhat Makes A Good Acoustic Guitar?\\nFender Acoustic Guitars – Current Range\\nFender California Series\\nFender Paramount Series\\nFender Classic Design Series\\nFender Alternative series\\nFender Artist Design Series\\nFender American Acoustasonic series\\nAre Fender Acoustic Guitars Good? Final Thoughts\\n\\nWhat Makes A Good Acoustic Guitar?\\nGood means many different things to many different people, but in the case of Fender acoustic guitars, with the exception of the\\xa0Acoustisonic\\xa0series, good really means, good value as the price has to be taken into consideration when discussing sub $500 guitars, which the majority of Fender’s acoustic line-up consists of.\\nMost professional/experienced guitarists won’t consider Fender a serious acoustic guitar brand. But, that misses the point as Fender hasn’t intentionally targeted this type of player.\\nTherefore, to give a verdict on Fender acoustic guitars we really need to take the opinions of actual buyers who own Fender acoustic guitars.\\n\\nFender Acoustic Guitars – Current Range\\nFender offers a fairly broad range of acoustic guitars.

Purists are less likely to give these guitars a second look, but based on the design and affordable, the California series of guitars will mostly appeal to electric guitarists looking for an alternative to the more traditional acoustic guitar design.\\nFender Paramount Series\\n\\nThe Fender Paramount series include 3 models of guitar, the imaginatively named PM-1 (dreadnought), PM-2

The Alkaline Trio will appeal to some, and not to others but overall has been well received and seems good value at under $300.\\nFender American Acoustasonic series\\n\\nLastly, we come to the Fender American Acoustasonic Series, perhaps the most radical departure from traditional acoustic guitar design seen yet.\\nThe American Acoustasonic Series includes both\\xa0Telecaster, Stratocaster and Jazzmaster options including the following models:\\nAmerican Acoustasonic TelecasterAmazon: 4.4Sweetwater: 4.5Guitar Center: 4.5Musicians Friend: NAReverb.com: 4.7Avg Rating: 4.52American Acoustasonic StratocasterAmazon: 5Sweetwater: 5Guitar Center: 4.5Musicians Friend: NAReverb.com: 5Avg Rating: 4.87American Acoustasonic JazzmasterAmazon: 4.5Sweetwater: 5Guitar Center: 4.5Musicians Friend: 4Reverb.com: 5Avg Rating: 4.6\\nAre they any good?\\xa0Average rating:\\xa04.695 stars\\nThe Acoustisonic series has been\\xa0well-received by critics, including several favorably high-profile reviews from guitarworld.com and\\xa0premierguitar.com.\\nThey’re not cheap, starting at just under $2000 but for an American-made Fender that includes a number of innovative features including the Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS) they represent good value and have been well-received.\\nAre Fender Acoustic Guitars Good? Final Thoughts\\nConsidering Fender’s history with regard to the acoustic guitar and where things appear to be headed with the Acoustisonic series it seems apparent that Fender will continue to look for new ways to approach acoustic guitar design.\\nAt the same time with a high number of guitars dedicated to the beginner marker including the FA and CD series, manufacturing good value, affordable yet highly playable acoustic guitars will also continue to take up a large part of Fender’s acoustic lineup.\\nWith all things considered, are Fender acoustic guitars any good?\\nBased on the customer ratings above, for a beginner on a budget, a Fender acoustic guitar is a great option.\\nAlso, be sure to check out our other guitar brand articles.\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n6 Of The Best British Acoustic Guitar Brands\\nWhile Britain is well regarded in the world of amplification (Marshall, Vox, Blackstar, and Orange) the acoustic guitar industry is....\\nRead Article\\n\\n8 Great Japanese Acoustic Guitar Brands\\nWhen we think of acoustic guitars, we often underappreciate how prevalent and innovative Japanese manufacturers have been throughout the history....\\nRead Article\\n\\n6 Great Australian Acoustic Guitar Brands\\nToday we’re taking a look at 5 Australian Acoustic Guitar Brands.

Produced in Fender’s Ensenada, Mexico, factory, the line comprises Stratocasters and Telecasters from the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s; a ’50s Jazzmaster; ’70s Jaguar and Mustang models and several basses from the same decades. For this review, I received guitars from three consecutive decades — a ’50s Jazzmaster, a ’60s Telecaster and a ’70s Mustang — which were tested with a trio of Fender amps (a Deluxe Reverb, a ’48 Dual Professional and a Tone Master Princeton Reverb) and several grind pedals, including the new UAFX Lion ’68 Super Lead.\\n’50s Jazzmaster\\nIntroduced in 1958, the Jazzmaster was presented as a flagship model for jazz players, but when that plan didn’t go as expected, it found a foothold in the 1960s surf scene. Decades later, the Jazzmaster attained its rightful place in the Fender hierarchy via alternative, grunge and indie players of the ’80s and ’90s.\\nThe swanky ’50s Jazzmaster that I received for this review looks ever so sharp in its Desert Sand paint and gold anodized pickguard, and it features a tinted maple neck with a late-’50s C shape, a slab rosewood fingerboard with a 25 ½–inch scale, and 21 nicely worked and polished vintage-tall frets. Bolted to an offset-waist alder body with beautifully rounded curves and a comfy ribcage contour, it has an enticing playing feel, with the factory setup providing low action and tuneful intonation.\\nEquipped with an adjustable bridge and floating trem, the Jazzmaster stayed in tune under moderate vibrato use, and the soft response of the long bar is really nice. The system has a trem-lock feature that will hold the tuning if a string breaks. When this happens, the plate tilts back from the loss of tension. You simply push the trem bar down, slide the switch back and it will hold the plate level so the guitar plays in tune, even with the broken string. An explanation of how the system works can be found here.\\n\\nThe ’50s Jazzmaster’s trem system includes a trem-lock — but no instructions on its use. (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe Jazzmaster’s pair of large single-coil pickups are fairly low output, which can be good for pedal users. They’re complemented by an adventurous control scheme consisting of master volume and tone knobs, a three-way toggle for selecting pickups, and, on the upper bout, a slider switch that activates the neck pickup by itself (which sounds a touch darker in this mode) and volume and tone thumbwheels that let you adjust its sound independently of the other controls. Simply put, it functions like a preset for the neck pickup that can be handy for quickly switching between, say, a gnarly bridge-pickup lead tone and a warm rhythm sound.\\nThe Jazzmaster’s tones are crisp and harmonically vibrant, and the sound with both pickups on is great for rhythm playing — clean or distorted — while the rear pickup delivers a killer lead tone through distortion or fuzz pedals. A Jazzmaster has its jangly charms for sure, and those clean sounds are addictive in their own way, but this sexy guitar can sound mighty too, which is why players like J Mascis, Troy Van Leeuwen, Jim Root and many others are fans of the Fender that’s “jazz” in name only.\\n’60s Telecaster\\nThe popularity of Fender guitars from the 1960s has lifted the prices of vintage models beyond the reach of many players, so it was cool to receive the very affordable Vintera II ’60s Telecaster that arrived here in a Fiesta Red finish, complemented by a three-ply white pickguard and chrome hardware. The bolt-on maple neck has an early ’60s profile that sits nicely in the hand, and the slab rosewood fingerboard features the traditional 25 ½–inch scale and narrowish 7 ¼–inch radius.\\nRiding atop are 21 vintage-tall frets with well-attended crowns, smooth tips and a gleaming polish. A good factory setup makes for excellent playability, negligible string buzz and sweet intonation along the gloss-finished neck. The strings load through metal ferrules on the back of the instrument, running across an adjustable three-saddle steel bridge on their way over a smoothly finished nut to the vintage-style, ribbed-back\\xa0tuners, which are the same types that are used on the Jazzmaster.\\n\\nThe ’60s Tele’s bridge pickup sounds fat, with a steely top end.\\xa0 (Image credit: Fender)\\nThis guitar felt solid and stayed in tune well during my tests, and despite being a bit on the heavy side, at nearly eight pounds, its acoustic voice sounded resonant and sustaining — characteristics that translated nicely into the amplified realm through my Fender test combos. The bridge pickup is fat sounding and packs a steely top end, and sounded badass through distortion pedals or straight into the ’48 Dual Pro, which enhanced everything with its unique flavor of grind and uncanny responsiveness to the guitar volume control. Switching to both pickups yielded tones that were clear and robust, with a touch of phasey color that’s cool for funk riffing.\\nAll in all, the ’60s Telecaster is a supreme working-musician’s guitar that covers a lot of bases, which is why, more than a half century since its introduction, it’s still so popular and continues to remind us just how far ahead of the curve Leo Fender was in 1950.\\n’70s Mustang\\nFamed Mustang players include Adrian Belew, Kurt Cobain and John Frusciante, and the model has remained popular with fans of its compact, offset design ever since it debuted in 1964. The Vintera II ’70s Mustang features a Competition Orange finish with white racing stripes (also available in Competition Burgundy), three-ply pearloid pickguard, large ’70s-style headstock, and “F”-stamped neck plate and tuners with white buttons.\\nIn keeping with its original intent to be a compact student model, the guitar has a smaller-proportioned alder body and a bolt-on maple neck with a 24-inch scale rosewood fingerboard wearing 21 nicely finished vintage-tall frets. The C-shaped neck on my review guitar has exceptionally figured maple and sits well in the hand, offering an easy playing feel with rubbery bendability courtesy of the shorter scale.\\nThe Dynamic Vibrato is a cool feature comprising a wraparound tailpiece that rocks in concert with a six-saddle adjustable bridge when pressing down on the bar. Held in place by a set screw (i.e. it’s not threaded), the bar has a tendency to come loose and can even pop right out if you don’t keep the screw firmly tightened. That aside, the unit allowed for aggressive use while keeping the pitch relatively stable once the strings were stretched out.\\n\\nThe ’70s Mustang has an easy playing feel — but watch out for the potentially errant vibrato bar.\\xa0 (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe Mustang sports a pair of single-coil pickups with black plastic covers; volume and tone pots with black knobs; and a pair of three-position slide switches to turn the pickups on and off individually, with center being off. The sound is loudest and fullest with both switches set toward the neck, and slightly hollower with a bit less output when both are pointed toward the bridge. Set both switches to the inward or outward positions and the sound is funky and out-of-phase.\\nThe pickups sound good on their own, too — the neck position delivers a clear, girthy tone that’s cool for blues when pushing some grind, and it steers into jazzy territory with the tone knob rolled down a bit. The bridge pickup has good output, and its bright, balanced tone sounded great for lead and rhythm through a cranked amp or distortion pedal, where the Mustang cops an aggressive attitude that’s pretty cool given its sort of toy-like demeanor, compared to full-sized Fenders.\\nBottom line, the Vintera II ’70s Mustang is a hip guitar for those who appreciate Fender’s outlier compact models.\\nSpecifications: Vintera II ’50s Jazzmaster\\n\\nUsed by members of Dinosaur Jr, Queens of the Stone Age and Slipknot, it\\'s jazz in name only.

guitar sales have grown 17% during the pandemic and are expected to top $700 million this year as housebound consumers look for new hobbies, says Fender Musical Instruments Corp. CEO Andy Mooney.\\nThe company\\'s online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele, is helping to drive consumer interest in the brand.\\nThis fall it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses.\\n\\nFender Musical Instruments\\' CEO Andy Mooney says a boom in guitar sales is happening during the coronavirus pandemic.\\nHenry Diltz\\nBusiness was looking pretty grim for Fender Musical Instruments Corp., the legendary guitar maker, when the coronavirus pandemic reached U.S. shores last March. Suddenly, 90% of its worldwide dealers\\' physical stores closed, as did many of its online sellers\\' distribution centers. Fender\\'s factories in Corona, California, and Ensenada, Mexico, shut down, furloughing hundreds of employees. Its headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, shuttered, as did its Hollywood hub, where CEO Andy Mooney and his management team work.\\n\"We were looking over the edge of an abyss, frankly, and went into company preservation mode,\" Mooney told CNBC in late October, while still running things from his home in L.A. after summering in Long Island. He and every other one of Fender\\'s roughly 2,000 employees took up to 50% pay cuts. \"We just tightened our belt.\"\\nWell, in the topsy-turvy world that Covid-19 has wrought, Fender\\'s bad fortunes have since turned upside down — to the merry melody of record-setting sales, estimated by Mooney to top $700 million this year, rising nearly 17% from last year\\'s more than $600 million. \"We are anticipating 2021 being another record year,\" he predicted, \"no matter how the pandemic plays out.\"\\nGuitar sales explode during pandemic\\nAs much pain as the pandemic initially inflicted upon Fender, the virus has also produced a balm. The turnaround actually began in late March with what Mooney describes as \"purely a goodwill gesture\" to the unexpectedly housebound public looking to take up hobbies other than baking bread and riding bikes. The company offered Fender Play, the online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele introduced in July 2017, free for 90 days to the first 100,000 subscribers.\\nFender hit that mark the very first day, reached a half million sign-ups the first week and settled at about 930,000 subscribers by June. Nearly 20% of the newcomers were under 24, and 70% were under 45, the company reported. Female users accounted for 45% of the new wave, compared with 30% before the pandemic. \"I never would have possibly predicted that,\" Mooney said, noting that the same offer has been extended to the end of this year.\\nSimultaneously, Fender saw sales of Stratocasters, Telecasters, Jazzmasters, Precision basses and other iconic electric guitar models surge, along with orders for acoustic guitars, ukuleles, amplifiers, home-recording equipment and other gear. Fender models selling for under $500 grew 92% from mid-March to mid-October; most were acoustic guitars bought online by beginners. More experienced players go for pricier electric guitars, ranging from an entry-level Strat for around $700 to an Acoustasonic for $3,300.\\nWhen Fender reopened the factories in April, it rehired laid-off workers and added extra shifts to keep up with demand. Plus, it had ample inventory to support the flood of online sales among its U.S. network of about 1,000 authorized dealers. \"Our distribution centers, owned by third parties, never closed, even as dealers\\' did,\" Mooney explained. \"We shipped product directly to consumers on their behalf.\" Most Fender branded guitars are manufactured in Corona and Ensenada, though some are produced in Japan and Southeast Asia.\\nBesides its own e-commerce operation — accelerated since Mooney was hired in 2015 — Fender sells online through pure-play instrument e-tailers such as Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Sweetwater and Thomann, headquartered in Germany, as well as Amazon, Walmart and Target. Pre-Covid, half of Fender\\'s sales were online, Mooney said, and have since swelled to 70%.\\n\"At Sweetwater, we are seeing 50% to 100% year-over-year growth across most guitar brands, both acoustic and electric guitars, and at all price points,\" said Mike Clem, the website\\'s chief digital officer. \"Some beginner instruments are seeing triple-digit YOY growth.\"\\nMusic buffs take up guitar-playing\\nFender, founded in 1946 by radio repairman turned guitar inventor Leo Fender in Fullerton, California, still relies on hundreds of bricks-and-mortar music stores, a key gateway to the brand ubiquitous among rock and rollers past and present, including Buddy Holly, Dick Dale, Bonnie Raitt, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Susan Tedeschi and John Mayer.\\nGuitar Center, a prominent Fender seller based in Westlake Village, California, closed most of its nearly 300 locations when the pandemic hit. \"We saw a shift of consumers to our e-commerce channels,\" said Michael Doyle, senior vice president, guitar and tech merchandising. That translated to a triple-digit sales growth for Fender and other top guitar brands on its website, particularly among new strummers.\\n\"Covid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner player,\" Doyle added. \"In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack,\" featuring a Squier Stratocaster electric guitar and Frontman amp for $220. (Nonetheless, Guitar Center, the nation\\'s largest musical instrument retailer — which generated $2.3 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year, but is mired in about $1.3 billion in debt — missed a $45-million interest payment last month and filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 13 concurrent with a debt restructuring plan, with the hope of balancing its books by early next year and its business operations continuing uninterrupted.)\\nWhile the pandemic played havoc with Fender\\'s 2020, the company has been steadily retuning its marketing strategy under Mooney, who previously boosted brands for Quiksilver, Disney and Nike. Another Nike alumnus, Evan Jones, was hired as Fender\\'s first-ever chief marketing officer around the same time Mooney arrived. \"The company has shifted from trade-based to consumer-based marketing,\" Jones said. \"We\\'ve built a full-fledged, integrated organization that allows us to invest in community-building through social channels, CRM and a visual ecosystem.\"\\n\\nCovid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner [guitar] player. In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack.\\nMichael Doyle\\nsenior vice president, Guitar Center\\n\\nThat organization — along with Fender\\'s design and production operations — was put to the test in October when it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses. Fender hired Wieden+Kennedy, known for its Nike ads, to work alongside its in-house creative team to develop a campaign dubbed \"For One. For All.\" The launch included producing videos starring 20 professional guitarists playing the new models and heralding their improvements. \"They\\'re able to articulate what the instruments do as well as or better than any product reviews,\" Jones maintained.\\nChurning out new products\\nThe design process for the new series began more than two years ago, said Justin Norvell, executive vice president of products. \"We talked to players, beginners to pros, to figure out what drives them, inspires them, what they\\'re looking for,\" he said. So, while the new Strat, Telecaster and other updated models look like their classic selves, changes were made to the necks, fingerboards and pickups to improve sound and feel. \"A lot of that comes down to manufacturing technology and quality control to create instruments that are easier to play,\" Norvell said.\\nNorvell coordinated that effort with Fender\\'s executive vice president of operations, Ed Magee, who was challenged with gearing up the factories after the pandemic shutdowns. \"We brought back most of the furloughed employees,\" he said, and reconfigured workstations to allow for social distancing. \"We had to source masks and other PPE,\" he added. \"We had to innovate on the fly, but worker safety comes first.\"\\nThe culmination of the design and production efforts is when a guitarist straps on a Fender, like the new Acoustasonic Strat Nile Rodgers recently got his hands on. A Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, he and his bandmate, the late bassist Bernard Edwards, created a funky disco sound in the early 1970s that defined an entire era with enduring hits like \"Good Times\" and \"Le Freak.\"\\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Nile Rodgers is developing a different sound on the Fender Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid.\\nFender Musical Instruments\\nRodgers still plays the white 1960 Strat, nicknamed the Hitmaker, that he traded for at a pawn shop in Hialeah, Florida, in 1973, but is developing a different sound on the Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid. \"When I got the instrument, I started practicing on it and came up with a whole new concept,\" he said. The result is heard on a song, \"Inside the Box,\" and video he made with Fender, highlighting the instrument\\'s multiple voice pairings.\\nThe experience has inspired Rodgers to practice relentlessly and compose dozens of new songs while locked down at home in Westport, Connecticut. \"I made a promise to myself — I\\'m 68 now — that by the time I\\'m 69, I\\'m going to be a better guitar player.\"\\nKatie Pruitt, 26, an up-and-coming country/folk/pop vocalist and guitarist and songwriter, is a comparative neophyte whose mother introduced her to the guitar as a kid growing up outside of Atlanta. \"She played in our church, and I learned basic chords from her,\" Pruitt said. She kept at it through high school and joined a band while attending Belmont University in Nashville, where she now lives and makes music.\\nPruitt\\'s parents bought her a Strat she still plays, \"and I got a Jazzmaster that I also used in making \\'Expectations,\\'\" she said, referring to her debut album, released in February. She promotes both the record and the Jazzmaster, among the American Professional II models, in a \"Fender Sessions\" video, featuring the title song, made with her current band. Like so many musicians whose live concerts have been canceled during the pandemic, Pruitt has been using the at-home time to work on new material. \"My mind is fully submerged into writing a second record,\" she said.\\nFender helps spawn new artists like Katie Pruitt, an up-and-coming songwriter and vocalist.\\nMichael Weintrob\\nWhile Fender may well help spawn new artists from the beginners taking its online lessons and buying its instruments in droves, Mooney said research revealed that \"90% of first-time players who pick up the guitar abandon it in the first year.\" But on the flip side of that sharp drop off, he added, the 10% who remain committed buy several more guitars. \"They have a lifetime value of $10,000,\" he calculated, \"and that\\'s a $1 billion bubble on top of sustainable, organic growth.\"\\nNo wonder Mooney is optimistic about not only Fender\\'s future, but that of the entire fretted instruments industry — which last year topped $8 billion, according to research organization Music Trades — that it dominates. \"I keep reminding people that we\\'re a growth company operating in a growth industry.\"\\nThe pandemic has changed the way people create and consume content and access entertainment.

The increasing music enthusiasm among millennials is projected to be a key factor driving the market. Additionally, the rising number of live concerts, along with the commercialization of music festivals, augments the demand for musical instruments, such as electric guitars. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the global market owing to the disruptions caused in the supply chain and the imposition of lockdown across several countries in the world.\\n\\nA surge in product sales was observed toward the end of July 2020 as several consumers started taking up hobbies, which led to the overall growth in the market. Music has become an important aspect of some of the school curricula across the globe. The primary and higher schools are focusing on music education programs and molding their curriculum policies to be friendlier toward music. These factors are expected to boost the product demand in the coming years.\\nElectric guitars are generally used in metal and rock genres of music. The popularity of these genres has increased, which is one of the major factors driving the market. Another factor driving the market is the rise in the number of musical bands across the globe. Demographic trends show growth in the adolescent population, which tends to take up lots of leisure activities. This, in turn, has led to a rise in the demand for musical instruments, especially electric guitars.\\nRegions like North America and the Middle East offer immense opportunities for demand fulfillment considering the advent of online retail platforms. Moreover, governments’ willingness to diversify their economies across the globe has led to a huge impetus for commercial music schools and colleges. For instance, in February 2020, the Berklee College of Music was established in Dubai, UAE. Such favorable scenarios bode well for the growth of the market.\\nWith technological advancements and the growth of internet penetration, music education can reach more students around the world. Video conferencing, instant messaging, file sharing, and using digital whiteboards are the medium for the online music education market. Digital music tools like YouTube, Digital sheet music and apps, and cloud-based systems are transforming the music education industry from the traditional music learning process.\\nThe online music and video creation and promotion industry are creating more demand for online music education, which, in turn, is anticipated to drive the market. The demand for online performances and virtual classes to learn a new instrument is expected to grow over the forecast period. This, in turn, has inspired consumers and motivated them to buy a new instrument and learn, especially from the convenience of their houses.\\nProduct Insights\\nSolid-body electric guitars held the largest revenue share of over 65.0% in 2022. These guitars are prevalent worldwide due to the popularity of rock and metal genres of music. Furthermore, bands widely use solid-body electric guitars for rock music. Consequently, the rise in the number of bands worldwide is expected to boost the demand for solid-body electric guitars in the future. For instance, according to Geography Realm, in May 2021, Finland has 70.6 heavy metal bands per 100,000 people as compared to 53.2 heavy metal bands per 100,000 people in 2012.\\nSemi-hollow body electric guitars are expected to expand at a lucrative CAGR of 7.2% over the forecast period. Semi-hollow electric guitars are popular as they have the properties of both hollow body and solid-body electric guitars. The rise in the number of bands worldwide is expected to boost the demand for semi-hollow electric guitars in the future..\\nDistribution Channel Insights\\nThe offline channel segment accounted for the largest revenue share of over 70.0% in 2022. After the lockdowns were gradually lifted in various countries across the globe, product sales via offline stores increased. For instance, according to a blog published by Guitar.com, the iconic Guitar Center store on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California saw a triple-digit jump in sales in August 2020 (compared to August 2019), which the company attributed to a rise in amateur musicians and podcasters buying gear to utilize while in lockdown for COVID-19. The offline distribution channels offer significant advantages, such as freedom of selection, low product prices, and high visibility of brands, making them a suitable platform for all types of customers.\\n\\nThe online channel segment is expected to register a lucrative CAGR in the forecast period. This growth is attributed to various factors that include the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ease and convenience of product purchasing. According to a blog by Music Strive, 2021, despite having closed factories in March and April 2020, Fender finished the year with a high of USD 700 million, nearly 17% more than what was achieved in 2019. The trend of online purchasing of instruments will continue in the forecast period.\\nRegional Insights\\nAsia Pacific held the largest revenue share of over 35.0% in 2022. A strong consumer influence and rapidly evolving consumer tastes on account of the increasing levels of per capita disposable income have been driving the market in the region. The growing interest of people in music and the ability to spend on entertainment and leisure activities have further boosted the demand for electric guitars in the Asia Pacific. Moreover, the increasing number of musical bands conducting music shows and festivals is likely to propel market growth over the forecast period.\\n\\nNorth America is expected to register a CAGR of 7.0 % from 2023 to 2030 owing to the increasing number of music concerts and the rising popularity of live-music concepts across the region. Additionally, major electric guitar manufacturers such as Gibson Brands, Inc.; Fender Musical Instruments; Karl Höfner GmbH & Co. KG; Ibanez guitars; Yamaha Corporation; and Michael Kelly Guitar Co. are launching innovative variants to penetrate further into the market and acquire a large customer base in the region, which has been fueling the growth of the market.\\nKey Companies & Market Share Insights\\nPlayers in this market face intense competition as some of them are among the top manufacturers and distributors of musical instruments with a large customer base. Moreover, these market players have strong and vast distribution networks, which help them reach a larger customer base across the world. The impact of major players on the market is high as most of these players have a global presence and implement various business strategies, such as product launches and developments, mergers & acquisitions, business expansion, partnerships and collaborations, and distribution channel strengthening, to grow further and acquire a larger share in the market:\\n\\n\\nIn July 2023, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) announced the launch of a range of new releases from its wholly-owned and licensed brands, including Jackson, Gretsch guitars, EVH, and Charvel. Each of these new models continues to uphold the brands\\' longstanding reputation for exceptional quality, tone, and technique, catering to the evolving requirements of musicians.\\n\\n\\nIn June 2023, PRS Guitars and John Mayer introduced two updates: a new version with a maple fretboard and a fresh color option for the rosewood-equipped model. These updates mark the first color refresh for the rosewood model since its initial launch in January 2022.\\n\\n\\nSome prominent players in the global electric guitars market include:\\n\\n\\nGibson Brands, Inc.\\n\\n\\nFender Musical Instruments Corporation\\n\\n\\nKarl Höfner GmbH & Co.

The increasing music enthusiasm among millennials is projected to be a key factor driving the market. Additionally, the rising number of live concerts, along with the commercialization of music festivals, augments the demand for musical instruments, such as electric guitars. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the global market owing to the disruptions caused in the supply chain and the imposition of lockdown across several countries in the world.\\n\\nA surge in product sales was observed toward the end of July 2020 as several consumers started taking up hobbies, which led to the overall growth in the market. Music has become an important aspect of some of the school curricula across the globe. The primary and higher schools are focusing on music education programs and molding their curriculum policies to be friendlier toward music. These factors are expected to boost the product demand in the coming years.\\nElectric guitars are generally used in metal and rock genres of music. The popularity of these genres has increased, which is one of the major factors driving the market. Another factor driving the market is the rise in the number of musical bands across the globe. Demographic trends show growth in the adolescent population, which tends to take up lots of leisure activities. This, in turn, has led to a rise in the demand for musical instruments, especially electric guitars.\\nRegions like North America and the Middle East offer immense opportunities for demand fulfillment considering the advent of online retail platforms. Moreover, governments’ willingness to diversify their economies across the globe has led to a huge impetus for commercial music schools and colleges. For instance, in February 2020, the Berklee College of Music was established in Dubai, UAE. Such favorable scenarios bode well for the growth of the market.\\nWith technological advancements and the growth of internet penetration, music education can reach more students around the world. Video conferencing, instant messaging, file sharing, and using digital whiteboards are the medium for the online music education market. Digital music tools like YouTube, Digital sheet music and apps, and cloud-based systems are transforming the music education industry from the traditional music learning process.\\nThe online music and video creation and promotion industry are creating more demand for online music education, which, in turn, is anticipated to drive the market. The demand for online performances and virtual classes to learn a new instrument is expected to grow over the forecast period. This, in turn, has inspired consumers and motivated them to buy a new instrument and learn, especially from the convenience of their houses.\\nProduct Insights\\nSolid-body electric guitars held the largest revenue share of over 65.0% in 2022. These guitars are prevalent worldwide due to the popularity of rock and metal genres of music. Furthermore, bands widely use solid-body electric guitars for rock music. Consequently, the rise in the number of bands worldwide is expected to boost the demand for solid-body electric guitars in the future. For instance, according to Geography Realm, in May 2021, Finland has 70.6 heavy metal bands per 100,000 people as compared to 53.2 heavy metal bands per 100,000 people in 2012.\\nSemi-hollow body electric guitars are expected to expand at a lucrative CAGR of 7.2% over the forecast period. Semi-hollow electric guitars are popular as they have the properties of both hollow body and solid-body electric guitars. The rise in the number of bands worldwide is expected to boost the demand for semi-hollow electric guitars in the future..\\nDistribution Channel Insights\\nThe offline channel segment accounted for the largest revenue share of over 70.0% in 2022. After the lockdowns were gradually lifted in various countries across the globe, product sales via offline stores increased. For instance, according to a blog published by Guitar.com, the iconic Guitar Center store on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California saw a triple-digit jump in sales in August 2020 (compared to August 2019), which the company attributed to a rise in amateur musicians and podcasters buying gear to utilize while in lockdown for COVID-19. The offline distribution channels offer significant advantages, such as freedom of selection, low product prices, and high visibility of brands, making them a suitable platform for all types of customers.\\n\\nThe online channel segment is expected to register a lucrative CAGR in the forecast period. This growth is attributed to various factors that include the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ease and convenience of product purchasing. According to a blog by Music Strive, 2021, despite having closed factories in March and April 2020, Fender finished the year with a high of USD 700 million, nearly 17% more than what was achieved in 2019. The trend of online purchasing of instruments will continue in the forecast period.\\nRegional Insights\\nAsia Pacific held the largest revenue share of over 35.0% in 2022. A strong consumer influence and rapidly evolving consumer tastes on account of the increasing levels of per capita disposable income have been driving the market in the region. The growing interest of people in music and the ability to spend on entertainment and leisure activities have further boosted the demand for electric guitars in the Asia Pacific. Moreover, the increasing number of musical bands conducting music shows and festivals is likely to propel market growth over the forecast period.\\n\\nNorth America is expected to register a CAGR of 7.0 % from 2023 to 2030 owing to the increasing number of music concerts and the rising popularity of live-music concepts across the region. Additionally, major electric guitar manufacturers such as Gibson Brands, Inc.; Fender Musical Instruments; Karl Höfner GmbH & Co.

[Real Customer Ratings]\\n\\nFender, one of the most recognizable brands in guitars, enjoys an enviable reputation for its iconic range of electric guitars and amplifiers. But, how do guitarists feel about their acoustic models?\\nFender acoustic guitars are good for beginners and compare favorably to guitars of a similarly affordable price from brands such as Yamaha, Cort, and Alvarez. Unlike their range of electric guitars, Fender acoustic guitars are affordably priced due to being manufactured offshore, with the exception of their Acoustisonic series being made entirely in the US.\\nBut, don’t just take my word for it.\\nIn the following article, we’re going to take a closer look at Fender’s acoustic guitar range, and how customers who have bought their guitars genuinely feel about them.\\nWe’ve collected customer ratings from Amazon, Sweetwater, Guitar Center, Musicians Friend, and Reverb.com\\xa0and compiled an average customer rating for each popular model Fender offers.\\nSo, if you’re looking for a completely unbiased opinion on Fender acoustic guitars, stay tuned!\\xa0But first…\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWhat Makes A Good Acoustic Guitar?\\nFender Acoustic Guitars – Current Range\\nFender California Series\\nFender Paramount Series\\nFender Classic Design Series\\nFender Alternative series\\nFender Artist Design Series\\nFender American Acoustasonic series\\nAre Fender Acoustic Guitars Good? Final Thoughts\\n\\nWhat Makes A Good Acoustic Guitar?\\nGood means many different things to many different people, but in the case of Fender acoustic guitars, with the exception of the\\xa0Acoustisonic\\xa0series, good really means, good value as the price has to be taken into consideration when discussing sub $500 guitars, which the majority of Fender’s acoustic line-up consists of.\\nMost professional/experienced guitarists won’t consider Fender a serious acoustic guitar brand. But, that misses the point as Fender hasn’t intentionally targeted this type of player.\\nTherefore, to give a verdict on Fender acoustic guitars we really need to take the opinions of actual buyers who own Fender acoustic guitars.\\n\\nFender Acoustic Guitars – Current Range\\nFender offers a fairly broad range of acoustic guitars.

alternative to the more traditional acoustic guitar design.\\nFender Paramount Series\\n\\nThe Fender Paramount series include 3 models of guitar, the imaginatively named PM-1 (dreadnought), PM-2

The Alkaline Trio will appeal to some, and not to others but overall has been well received and seems good value at under $300.\\nFender American Acoustasonic series\\n\\nLastly, we come to the Fender American Acoustasonic Series, perhaps the most radical departure from traditional acoustic guitar design seen yet.\\nThe American Acoustasonic Series includes both\\xa0Telecaster, Stratocaster and Jazzmaster options including the following models:\\nAmerican Acoustasonic TelecasterAmazon: 4.4Sweetwater: 4.5Guitar Center: 4.5Musicians Friend: NAReverb.com: 4.7Avg Rating: 4.52American Acoustasonic StratocasterAmazon: 5Sweetwater: 5Guitar Center: 4.5Musicians Friend: NAReverb.com: 5Avg Rating: 4.87American Acoustasonic JazzmasterAmazon: 4.5Sweetwater: 5Guitar Center: 4.5Musicians Friend: 4Reverb.com: 5Avg Rating: 4.6\\nAre they any good?\\xa0Average rating:\\xa04.695 stars\\nThe Acoustisonic series has been\\xa0well-received by critics, including several favorably high-profile reviews from guitarworld.com and\\xa0premierguitar.com.\\nThey’re not cheap, starting at just under $2000 but for an American-made Fender that includes a number of innovative features including the Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS) they represent good value and have been well-received.\\nAre Fender Acoustic Guitars Good? Final Thoughts\\nConsidering Fender’s history with regard to the acoustic guitar and where things appear to be headed with the Acoustisonic series it seems apparent that Fender will continue to look for new ways to approach acoustic guitar design.\\nAt the same time with a high number of guitars dedicated to the beginner marker including the FA and CD series, manufacturing good value, affordable yet highly playable acoustic guitars will also continue to take up a large part of Fender’s acoustic lineup.\\nWith all things considered, are Fender acoustic guitars any good?\\nBased on the customer ratings above, for a beginner on a budget, a Fender acoustic guitar is a great option.\\nAlso, be sure to check out our other guitar brand articles.\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n6 Of The Best British Acoustic Guitar Brands\\nWhile Britain is well regarded in the world of amplification (Marshall, Vox, Blackstar, and Orange) the acoustic guitar industry is....\\nRead Article\\n\\n8 Great Japanese Acoustic Guitar Brands\\nWhen we think of acoustic guitars, we often underappreciate how prevalent and innovative Japanese manufacturers have been throughout the history....\\nRead Article\\n\\n6 Great Australian Acoustic Guitar Brands\\nToday we’re taking a look at 5 Australian Acoustic Guitar Brands.

It’s designed for the average player that wants a high-quality guitar for a lower price.\\n\\nTo put it in perspective, I own a high-end Fender Stratocaster. It cost a lot more than the Fender Player Series. It’s difficult for me to distinguish between the tones of the two instruments.\\nIf I were to hear both of them side-by-side, it would take me quite a while to determine which guitar was being played.

A lot of Fender guitars are made with alder. The body is a standard Fender Stratocaster size.\\nThe body of this instrument is lightweight, so it’s perfect for sitting down to play or standing up. There’s not much back strain when you play a Fender Stratocaster if you compare it to other instruments.\\nNeck\\nThe neck on the guitar is made from maple. You can get a morado fretboard or a maple fretboard. This all comes down to your personal preferences.\\nYou shouldn’t have any problem navigating the fretboard because Fender necks are easy to play. They’re usually quite smooth without any imperfections or problems with the frets.\\nPickups\\nThis guitar features three Player Series single-coil pickups. They give you standard Fender Stratocaster single-coil sounds. The pickups are excellent for blues, moderate rock, country, jazz, and similar styles.\\nIf you prefer heavy metal or more aggressive guitar styles, you can also get a Fender Player Series Stratocaster with two single-coils and a humbucker pickup.\\nSee more: Best Acoustic Guitar Pickups Buyer’s Guide\\nOther Parts\\nThe instrument features a standard Fender tremolo system, which comes with a tremolo arm.

The scale length is 25.5″, and the fretboard radius is 9.5″. The neck itself is C-shape and made from maple.

It’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to purchase this model.\\nIs the Fender Player Series Right for Me?\\nThis Fender model is an excellent choice for most players. This is because you get a Fender Stratocaster that sounds great but costs a lot less. It sounds great through most amps, and it’s perfect for multiple guitar styles.\\n\\nThere’s no reason to spend more on a Fender Stratocaster if you don’t want to. The Player Series gives you everything that you could want in a Fender guitar. I was quite happy with the sounds I got out of this instrument.\\nIf you like the sound of a Fender guitar and have never owned one before, this is a great introduction to the lineup. The sounds the instrument produces are exceptional for its price range, and the guitar is easy to play.\\nDoes the Fender Player Series Stratocaster Have Drawbacks?\\nThis guitar really doesn’t have a whole lot of drawbacks. It’s a well-built instrument, and you can get it for a great price. It may not have some of the higher-end pickups that more expensive Fender guitars have, but it’s still a great option.\\nThese guitars usually sound great right out of the box, although they may need a little bit of a setup before they’re playable for your needs. You can take it to a guitar technician to have the action, pickup height, and the intonation properly set.\\nHow Can I Make My Guitar Sound Better?\\nWhile the guitar has excellent pickups, they might not be the ideal option for your individual guitar style. You may want to change the pickups to make your guitar sound a bit more to your liking.\\nYou should use a good quality guitar cable to improve the signal. The guitar will sound better if you use a quality amplifier. The gear that you use with your guitar can help improve the tone.\\nAnother thing you can do to improve the sound is to ensure that you’re using fresh strings. When you get it out of the box, the guitar has probably been sitting there for a long time, so change the strings.\\nWhen playing this guitar through an amplifier, dial back the high-gain settings. The single coils will sound better at a moderate gain. If you want higher distortion settings, use a model that has a humbucking pickup.\\nCan I Play Fast on the Fender Player Series?\\nYou can play a lot of fast guitar on the Fender Player Series Guitar, although I wouldn’t call it an instrument that’s built for hard rock or metal styles. The Stratocaster really isn’t an instrument for this type of music.\\n\\nAlthough plenty of players have used the Stratocaster to play faster guitar styles, it’s generally better for moderate rock, blues, and similar styles. You won’t find this guitar ideal for advanced speed.\\nFender Player Stratocaster Warranty\\nThe warranty on your guitar will depend on where you purchase it from. If you buy online, please check with the retailer to see what type of warranty they offer. You can also speak to Fender about your guitar warranty.\\nWhere to Buy the Fender Player Stratocaster\\nThere are several places where you can pick up a Fender Player Stratocaster. I’ve listed the most popular ones below. These are my main recommendations as to where you can purchase one of these guitars.\\nAmazon\\nAmazon is one of the better online retailers that sell musical instruments as well as other products. They have a large selection, fast shipping, good customer service, and you can leave reviews on your purchases.\\nOrder Online\\nSweetwater and Guitar Center are two other locations where you can purchase musical instruments. These locations have an excellent selection, good customer service, fast shipping, and reasonable rates.\\nYour Local Store\\nYour local music store may also have a Fender Player Stratocaster in stock. Please keep in mind that not every location will carry this guitar, so you may have to special order it.\\nConclusion\\nThank you for reading my Fender Player Stratocaster review.

17% during the pandemic and are expected to top $700 million this year as housebound consumers look for new hobbies, says Fender Musical Instruments Corp. CEO Andy Mooney.\\nThe company\\'s online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele, is helping to drive consumer interest in the brand.\\nThis fall it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses.\\n\\nFender Musical Instruments\\' CEO Andy Mooney says a boom in guitar sales is happening during the coronavirus pandemic.\\nHenry Diltz\\nBusiness was looking pretty grim for Fender Musical Instruments Corp., the legendary guitar maker, when the coronavirus pandemic reached U.S. shores last March. Suddenly, 90% of its worldwide dealers\\' physical stores closed, as did many of its online sellers\\' distribution centers. Fender\\'s factories in Corona, California, and Ensenada, Mexico, shut down, furloughing hundreds of employees. Its headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, shuttered, as did its Hollywood hub, where CEO Andy Mooney and his management team work.\\n\"We were looking over the edge of an abyss, frankly, and went into company preservation mode,\" Mooney told CNBC in late October, while still running things from his home in L.A. after summering in Long Island. He and every other one of Fender\\'s roughly 2,000 employees took up to 50% pay cuts. \"We just tightened our belt.\"\\nWell, in the topsy-turvy world that Covid-19 has wrought, Fender\\'s bad fortunes have since turned upside down — to the merry melody of record-setting sales, estimated by Mooney to top $700 million this year, rising nearly 17% from last year\\'s more than $600 million. \"We are anticipating 2021 being another record year,\" he predicted, \"no matter how the pandemic plays out.\"\\nGuitar sales explode during pandemic\\nAs much pain as the pandemic initially inflicted upon Fender, the virus has also produced a balm. The turnaround actually began in late March with what Mooney describes as \"purely a goodwill gesture\" to the unexpectedly housebound public looking to take up hobbies other than baking bread and riding bikes. The company offered Fender Play, the online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele introduced in July 2017, free for 90 days to the first 100,000 subscribers.\\nFender hit that mark the very first day, reached a half million sign-ups the first week and settled at about 930,000 subscribers by June. Nearly 20% of the newcomers were under 24, and 70% were under 45, the company reported. Female users accounted for 45% of the new wave, compared with 30% before the pandemic. \"I never would have possibly predicted that,\" Mooney said, noting that the same offer has been extended to the end of this year.\\nSimultaneously, Fender saw sales of Stratocasters, Telecasters, Jazzmasters, Precision basses and other iconic electric guitar models surge, along with orders for acoustic guitars, ukuleles, amplifiers, home-recording equipment and other gear. Fender models selling for under $500 grew 92% from mid-March to mid-October; most were acoustic guitars bought online by beginners. More experienced players go for pricier electric guitars, ranging from an entry-level Strat for around $700 to an Acoustasonic for $3,300.\\nWhen Fender reopened the factories in April, it rehired laid-off workers and added extra shifts to keep up with demand. Plus, it had ample inventory to support the flood of online sales among its U.S. network of about 1,000 authorized dealers. \"Our distribution centers, owned by third parties, never closed, even as dealers\\' did,\" Mooney explained. \"We shipped product directly to consumers on their behalf.\" Most Fender branded guitars are manufactured in Corona and Ensenada, though some are produced in Japan and Southeast Asia.\\nBesides its own e-commerce operation — accelerated since Mooney was hired in 2015 — Fender sells online through pure-play instrument e-tailers such as Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Sweetwater and Thomann, headquartered in Germany, as well as Amazon, Walmart and Target. Pre-Covid, half of Fender\\'s sales were online, Mooney said, and have since swelled to 70%.\\n\"At Sweetwater, we are seeing 50% to 100% year-over-year growth across most guitar brands, both acoustic and electric guitars, and at all price points,\" said Mike Clem, the website\\'s chief digital officer. \"Some beginner instruments are seeing triple-digit YOY growth.\"\\nMusic buffs take up guitar-playing\\nFender, founded in 1946 by radio repairman turned guitar inventor Leo Fender in Fullerton, California, still relies on hundreds of bricks-and-mortar music stores, a key gateway to the brand ubiquitous among rock and rollers past and present, including Buddy Holly, Dick Dale, Bonnie Raitt, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Susan Tedeschi and John Mayer.\\nGuitar Center, a prominent Fender seller based in Westlake Village, California, closed most of its nearly 300 locations when the pandemic hit. \"We saw a shift of consumers to our e-commerce channels,\" said Michael Doyle, senior vice president, guitar and tech merchandising. That translated to a triple-digit sales growth for Fender and other top guitar brands on its website, particularly among new strummers.\\n\"Covid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner player,\" Doyle added. \"In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack,\" featuring a Squier Stratocaster electric guitar and Frontman amp for $220. (Nonetheless, Guitar Center, the nation\\'s largest musical instrument retailer — which generated $2.3 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year, but is mired in about $1.3 billion in debt — missed a $45-million interest payment last month and filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 13 concurrent with a debt restructuring plan, with the hope of balancing its books by early next year and its business operations continuing uninterrupted.)\\nWhile the pandemic played havoc with Fender\\'s 2020, the company has been steadily retuning its marketing strategy under Mooney, who previously boosted brands for Quiksilver, Disney and Nike. Another Nike alumnus, Evan Jones, was hired as Fender\\'s first-ever chief marketing officer around the same time Mooney arrived. \"The company has shifted from trade-based to consumer-based marketing,\" Jones said. \"We\\'ve built a full-fledged, integrated organization that allows us to invest in community-building through social channels, CRM and a visual ecosystem.\"\\n\\nCovid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner [guitar] player. In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack.\\nMichael Doyle\\nsenior vice president, Guitar Center\\n\\nThat organization — along with Fender\\'s design and production operations — was put to the test in October when it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses. Fender hired Wieden+Kennedy, known for its Nike ads, to work alongside its in-house creative team to develop a campaign dubbed \"For One. For All.\" The launch included producing videos starring 20 professional guitarists playing the new models and heralding their improvements. \"They\\'re able to articulate what the instruments do as well as or better than any product reviews,\" Jones maintained.\\nChurning out new products\\nThe design process for the new series began more than two years ago, said Justin Norvell, executive vice president of products. \"We talked to players, beginners to pros, to figure out what drives them, inspires them, what they\\'re looking for,\" he said. So, while the new Strat, Telecaster and other updated models look like their classic selves, changes were made to the necks, fingerboards and pickups to improve sound and feel. \"A lot of that comes down to manufacturing technology and quality control to create instruments that are easier to play,\" Norvell said.\\nNorvell coordinated that effort with Fender\\'s executive vice president of operations, Ed Magee, who was challenged with gearing up the factories after the pandemic shutdowns. \"We brought back most of the furloughed employees,\" he said, and reconfigured workstations to allow for social distancing. \"We had to source masks and other PPE,\" he added. \"We had to innovate on the fly, but worker safety comes first.\"\\nThe culmination of the design and production efforts is when a guitarist straps on a Fender, like the new Acoustasonic Strat Nile Rodgers recently got his hands on. A Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, he and his bandmate, the late bassist Bernard Edwards, created a funky disco sound in the early 1970s that defined an entire era with enduring hits like \"Good Times\" and \"Le Freak.\"\\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Nile Rodgers is developing a different sound on the Fender Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid.\\nFender Musical Instruments\\nRodgers still plays the white 1960 Strat, nicknamed the Hitmaker, that he traded for at a pawn shop in Hialeah, Florida, in 1973, but is developing a different sound on the Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid. \"When I got the instrument, I started practicing on it and came up with a whole new concept,\" he said. The result is heard on a song, \"Inside the Box,\" and video he made with Fender, highlighting the instrument\\'s multiple voice pairings.\\nThe experience has inspired Rodgers to practice relentlessly and compose dozens of new songs while locked down at home in Westport, Connecticut. \"I made a promise to myself — I\\'m 68 now — that by the time I\\'m 69, I\\'m going to be a better guitar player.\"\\nKatie Pruitt, 26, an up-and-coming country/folk/pop vocalist and guitarist and songwriter, is a comparative neophyte whose mother introduced her to the guitar as a kid growing up outside of Atlanta. \"She played in our church, and I learned basic chords from her,\" Pruitt said. She kept at it through high school and joined a band while attending Belmont University in Nashville, where she now lives and makes music.\\nPruitt\\'s parents bought her a Strat she still plays, \"and I got a Jazzmaster that I also used in making \\'Expectations,\\'\" she said, referring to her debut album, released in February. She promotes both the record and the Jazzmaster, among the American Professional II models, in a \"Fender Sessions\" video, featuring the title song, made with her current band. Like so many musicians whose live concerts have been canceled during the pandemic, Pruitt has been using the at-home time to work on new material. \"My mind is fully submerged into writing a second record,\" she said.\\nFender helps spawn new artists like Katie Pruitt, an up-and-coming songwriter and vocalist.\\nMichael Weintrob\\nWhile Fender may well help spawn new artists from the beginners taking its online lessons and buying its instruments in droves, Mooney said research revealed that \"90% of first-time players who pick up the guitar abandon it in the first year.\" But on the flip side of that sharp drop off, he added, the 10% who remain committed buy several more guitars. \"They have a lifetime value of $10,000,\" he calculated, \"and that\\'s a $1 billion bubble on top of sustainable, organic growth.\"\\nNo wonder Mooney is optimistic about not only Fender\\'s future, but that of the entire fretted instruments industry — which last year topped $8 billion, according to research organization Music Trades — that it dominates. \"I keep reminding people that we\\'re a growth company operating in a growth industry.\"\\nThe pandemic has changed the way people create and consume content and access entertainment.

While electric guitar sales boomed in the 60s and 70s, the market has declined in recent decades.\\nHowever, there are signs that the guitar market may be on the rebound.\\nIn this post, we’ll look at the numbers. The statistics that provide insights into guitar sales, production, consumers, and what it means.\\nA personal view on these numbers\\nThe guitar market appears to be in a state of flux currently. Prices for used gear are decreasing, while new instruments remain priced high. Some brands are offering more flexible deals on their guitars and amplifiers.\\nThis points to a “soft” market, where supply currently exceeds demand. From a manufacturing standpoint, it’s becoming difficult to meet demand for custom builds, given long wait times for components and limited production capacity.\\nHowever, major players like Fender and Gibson still command premium pricing for their instruments.\\nOverall, the guitar industry faces some challenges but retains a committed user base. Brands may need to adapt to meet changing consumer demands in order to thrive in the years ahead.\\nTable of Contents\\nGuitar Sales Statistics and Market Size\\nThe industry has shown significant growth, with US sales reaching $1.3 billion in 2021, marking an increase from the previous year.\\nThe market globally is expected to expand from $2.61 billion in 2021 to $3.60 billion by 2026, with a steady CAGR of 6.1%.\\nIn the US, electric guitars hold the majority market share, while acoustic and classical variants also maintain substantial segments.

Research regional policies, industrial demands and future applications to adapt your strategy accordingly. In some areas, localised or residential markets can outweigh the potential of grid-scale storage, residential or commercial applications. While in other areas, you might find more potential in the large-scale storage sector. So, it's crucial to identify the market requirements to optimise your strategy.\n",

Spend a good chunk of capital on R&D and consider establishing partnerships with academic institutions to remain ahead in terms of technological advancements. Your continued presence in the industry through new product releases, patents and presence at industry events can highlight your commitment to innovation and help you catch the eye of investors.\n",
