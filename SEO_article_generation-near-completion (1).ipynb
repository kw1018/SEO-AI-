The US market is dominated by electric guitars, particularly among young adults, suggesting a promising future for the industry. Gibson and Fender lead the brand race, but Fender is gaining popularity among younger musicians.\\nThe second-hand market is also thriving, with electric guitars making up 70% of used sales, and Reverb.com reporting significant transactions. The average selling price on Reverb indicates a market that values both affordability and quality, with mobile commerce playing a key role.\\nOnline sales have surged, particularly for acoustic guitars, with the pandemic driving a 90% increase in 2020. Guitar Center’s online sales have doubled, and Fender’s online sales have grown significantly, especially for entry-level models.\\nInterested in more lists and numbers?

Here’s how it works.\\n“The higher end the guitar, the more robust the demand is”: Why are guitars getting more expensive? We spoke to the world’s biggest guitar companies to find out\\nFrom $50k acoustics to eye-watering ‘premium offshore’ prices, the cost of big-name new guitars has felt like it’s spiraling. So how did we get here? And how do we get out of it?\\nRising prices have become a reality of life in 2024 and the guitar industry has been no exception, especially when it comes to the big names.\\nEpiphone’s latest Chinese-built models approach $1,500, while Fender’s Mexican-made Vintera IIs are heading north of the $1,000 mark. Meanwhile, the former mid-price tier, ie, the flagship US builds from the big firms, come in at anything between $2,000 and $5,000 – and the price tags of some custom shop guitars now seem to be approaching real estate levels. It seems like it’s everywhere.\\nSo why is it happening? What are guitar makers doing about it and, perhaps most importantly of all, where can you find value in a market that looks like it’s out to make New Guitar Day a thing of the past?\\nOver the past few months, we’ve been chatting to representatives from Fender, Gibson and Reverb about the situation, so strap in as we attempt to unravel just what is happening when it comes to the seemingly spiraling cost of gear.\\nWhy have prices risen so much?\\nLet’s start with the background. Economics 101 teaches us that when supply is low and demand is high, then prices will rise. The past few years have offered a perfect storm in this sense.\\nThe pandemic throttled supply chains around the world (as workers isolated and manufacturing slowed), while at the same time governments handed-out stimulus checks (ie, free money) to large swathes of the population.\\nThose who were fortunate enough to have the basics covered started looking for other ways to keep occupied during lockdown. As such, during Covid, the guitar industry enjoyed its biggest sales boom since The Beatles first invaded these shores. People had spare time and spare cash, retailers couldn’t supply guitars fast enough – and, as such, prices started to slowly creep up.\\nGet The Pick Newsletter\\nAll the latest guitar news, interviews, lessons, reviews, deals and more, direct to your inbox!\\nThat was just the start, though. As the world moved out of the pandemic, other shocks have hit global supply chains and, in turn, the guitar industry.\\nLike most manufacturing in the 21st century, guitar firms are dependent on a complex network of suppliers based all over the world.\\xa0Even a handmade US instrument needs electrical components, plastics and tone woods – and most of these will come from foreign suppliers.\\nIn a recent conversation, Fender’s Justin Norvell related to GW the issues the firm had faced just procuring tubes for its amp builds at the time.\\n“During the supply chain [crisis], it would be like the factory could make tubes,” explains Norvell.\\n“But the glass comes from Germany, and they couldn't get the glass. And then that goes back up the tree, to [issues sourcing] the silicon that makes the glass. It was really problematic, because there could be one small thing that was preventing us from getting anything.”\\nFender’s tube supply is, we’re told, “pretty dialed” at this point, but it’s a neat illustration of the nightmare scenario that faced all manufacturers.\\nFast-forward to 2024 and war in Ukraine and the Middle East, crumbling relations with China, increasing piracy on the world’s oceans (as the US pulls back on the world stage) and all manner of other fun-things-that-you-don’t-want-to-read-about-on-Guitar-World –\\xa0continue to affect global manufacturing/shipping costs.\\nThe guitar industry has some sizeable players – from Fender and Gibson, to PRS, Yamaha and Ibanez –\\xa0but they are all at the mercy of these global forces.\\n“There's just been a period where, really, we were able to not increase things for many years and people get used to that,” comments Norvell, when we ask him about the reasons behind recent price rises.\\n“And then at some point, it's wood, it's metal, it's labor –\\xa0wanting to pay the people who build our guitars more –\\xa0and all of these things come together, and create that environment.”\\nWhat are guitar makers doing about it?\\nRegardless of the reasons, the effects have hit just about every aspect of the guitar and wider music-making world and, while they won’t shout about it, most manufacturers have had to put up prices.\\nSome might be stealthier than others –\\xa0we’ve seen a fair bit of discontinuing old lines only to replace them with a slightly tweaked version at a higher price. This means it’s not a like-for-like swap and it’s harder for buyers to spot a price hike.\\nThis might seem nefarious, but then firms are positioned between a rock and a hard place, financially speaking. Faced with a choice of absorbing the costs until they’re bankrupt, or putting up prices and facing an online backlash, it’s hard to blame them for choosing the latter.\\nEven though there have been recent price increases, keeping guitars affordable and in the hands of people has been a massive priority and challenge of ours\\nIt means more pain for us guitar buyers, of course, but we still have a choice as consumers and, at least this way, the market dictates whether or not to accept the changes.\\nNorvell also makes the case that, historically speaking, the average guitar buyer still has it pretty good.\\n“The inflation thing is hyper-real,” acknowledges Norvell. “And I know that there's commentary about our prices over the years. [But equally] it's amazing how inexpensive guitars continue to be compared to other things that are crafted the way they are.\\n“If anyone took an inflation calculator and ran what a ’54 Strat was with a case, in ’54 it would be double the price of an American Professional. So even though there have been recent price increases, keeping guitars affordable and in the hands of people has been a massive priority and challenge of ours.”\\nWe checked this and Norvell is, if anything, underestimating the figures: a Fender Stratocaster bought for its list price of $317 in the mid-’50s would be equivalent to a price tag of $3,590 in 2024. Meanwhile, you can currently pick up an American Professional II Strat for $1,599.\\nEnter premium offshore builds\\nOne of the key effects of the shift in pricing has been a widening chasm in the price tags between firms’ more affordable offshore builds and their traditional US-made ranges. The answer, for many of them, has been a new tier of high-spec, high-quality foreign builds that we’ve come to (somewhat lazily) tag, ‘premium offshore’.\\nWhether it's the Yamaha Pacifica Professional (loaded with Rupert Neve pickups), Epiphone’s Inspired by Gibson Custom Shop line –\\xa0including the flagship Kirk Hammett Greeny (with open-book headstock and USA Greenybuckers) or Fender’s nitro-finished Mexican-made Mike McCready Stratocaster ($1,899) –\\xa0they’re all giving players something that feels desirable at a price that five or 10 years ago would have bought you a US-made guitar. From now on, premium offshore is the new mid-tier.\\nMuch of this is only possible thanks to the improvements in build quality, machinery and luthiery knowledge developed over the past 30 years or so and, while for his part, Norvell notes there is still the matter of ‘the soul’ of American-made instruments, he says that in the case of Fender’s Mexico facility, the relative proximity has paid dividends.\\n“We have people that go from [California],” says Norvell. “Master Builders that will drive the two-and-a-half hours or three hours down there, and they can impart all kinds of wisdom and keep moving that ball forward. If I think of a Mexico guitar from 1987 and the Mike McCready [Strat],\\xa0it is completely light years away… I think that just opens the aperture: premium offshore stuff just gives people another choice.”\\nOther firms might have to hop on a flight, but that hasn’t stopped them from employing similar knowledge shares. If you’d told us 10 years ago we’d be paying $1,500 for Epiphones in 2024 then we would have checked your meds, but now these guitars feature Custom Shop pickups, stunning finishes and a level of quality control that places them, comfortably, as the best non-US builds under the Gibson Brands umbrella.\\nScooping off the cream\\nOf course, the effects of inflation have not been felt equally across society, or the guitar industry.\\nTalk to an economist (oh OK, don’t) and they’ll tell you that luxury goods sales remain weirdly stable during tough economic periods. This seems counterintuitive at first – why would we keep buying luxuries when we have less spare cash in our pockets?\\nIt is because the wealthy are not so exposed to the effects of inflation. Take a look at the slew of record-breaking prices at the Mark Knopfler guitar auction last month and you’ll see the vintage and high-end guitar sales sector remains in good health.\\nIn terms of the really huge-dollar, vintage stuff, still trading hands, you have to realise the people who play in that market are really not hit by the price of milk and eggs\\n“In terms of the really huge-dollar, vintage stuff, still trading hands, you have to realise the people who play in that market are really not hit by the price of milk and eggs,” Gibson’s Director of Brand Experience –\\xa0and vintage guitar expert –\\xa0Mark Agnesi, told us last year.\\n“I'm sure Ferrari is not having any trouble with new releases sitting on the lot for a while, and Rolex doesn't have any problems – you still can't get one of those. It's a different market, with different players.”\\nFender’s CEO Andy Mooney also made a similar point to us in 2023: “We still get very high demand for Custom Shop guitars,” said the Fender chief. “Generally, in some ways, it's almost as if the higher the end of the guitar, the more robust the demand is.”\\nThis explains the raft of ultra-pricey, limited-edition models that have rolled out since the pandemic. To us average Joes, it might seem a little wild when the likes of Gibson launches the $20k Murphy Lab Aged With Brazilian Rosewood Les Pauls, Martin drops its $50k anniversary build, or another Bitcoin guitar or Manson debuts a $17,500 Matt Bellamy-inspired mirror mask model, but these products are designed to cream the market –\\xa0to charge top dollar from those that can afford it.\\nZeroes make heroes\\nThis is a classic premium pricing strategy –\\xa0the sort of thing that, as Agnesi alludes to, you see in everything from sports cars to watch brands and fashion houses. At those figures, the price is the headline feature –\\xa0one that’s more about creating a perceived value in the eyes of the wealthy buyer – than the cost of the materials alone.\\nIt also relates to another pricing strategy, known as ‘anchoring’ – and this is something it’s crucial to understand as a guitar buyer in 2024. Tell us if this sounds familiar…\\nWith an anchoring approach, you debut an ultra-exclusive (or limited) version of a desirable product at an intentionally eye-watering price, then when you roll out the next tier (say a standard USA model) at half that, or less, it seems like excellent value.\\nThen comes another tier at half that price and so on… The desire around that initial exclusivity trickles down until all the price points are covered and everyone gets their piece of the pie.\\nThis has long been the playbook of the guitar industry’s custom shop builds, but Gibson has harnessed this strategy incredibly effectively since its 2018 rebirth –\\xa0just look at the journey of the Greeny.\\nIt launched with a $50,000 Custom Shop limited edition build that was so exclusive we reported on individual sales of the model to celebrities like Jason Momoa and Tool’s Adam Jones, then came the $20,000 Gibson Custom Shop model, followed by the $3,199 Gibson USA build, right down to the $1,499 Epiphone.\\nThe Epiphone price is a massive 97% less than that original build –\\xa0but it’s still the highest price tag of any Epiphone Les Paul.\\nAs a result, they all still feel exclusive and desirable, and the prices feel much more reasonable in comparison to the headline-grabbing launch.\\nWhat’s more, as Agnesi also noted last year, Gibson has been even more constrained on the supply side than many of its rivals –\\xa0and that has actually benefited it in some ways, because it simply didn’t have the option of riding the supply and demand rollercoaster that buffeted the likes of Fender. As such, it hasn’t had to sell-off nearly as much left over stock.\\n“Since we took over ownership in 2018 and relaunched in 2019, we haven't been able to make enough guitars,” said Agnesi, in fall last year. “It was always on back order, and we'd need more. So we were never able to hit the numbers where we could start having warehouses and warehouses full of inventory.\\n“We were always trying to catch up with demand, which ultimately ended up being a good thing, I think, for us because that meant that we didn't get stuck holding, you know, $100 million worth of cancellable orders… through that whole thing, we were always trying to catch up to orders.”\\nThe $100 million figure is an allusion (one we should note Guitar World asked directly about) to Fender’s overproduction in the 2022 –\\xa0a year in which, according to Fender’s CFO, the pandemic boom and subsequent drop-off in demand led to the firm being stuck with $100 million worth of canceled orders.\\nFender ultimately navigated a tricky situation very successfully – resulting in their second-best year on record, but while brands are cagey on this sort of thing, rumor has it that the Big F was not the only one left up the creek, stock-wise, after the waters of the pandemic guitar boom subsided.\\nWhich brings us on to our next question.\\nWhere can you find value?\\nIn the face of the forces above, it might seem like it’s impossible to find value in the same way in the current guitar market, but there are still deals to be had. The fallout of the pandemic oversupply has left retailers and guitar brands with a lot of stock to shift, particularly at the lower end of the market.\\nThis is good news for you, if you’re after something under the $1,000 mark. This part of the market seemed to have the biggest discounts around Black Friday and the holiday sales (up to 40% in some cases). The likes of D’Angelico, Guild, Gretsch and Fender’s lower-rung items looked like great value – and even a few USA Gibsons were getting price cuts.\\nSome of those are still floating around with some pretty chunky reductions. Then there’s a few end-of-the-line models, like the Gibson Les Paul Tribute, which has already developed something of a cult following. There’s no discount, but stock is now being steadily sold off –\\xa0and we suspect that’s the last USA Gibson we’ll see priced below $1,300.\\nWe've seen continued strong demand as the value of higher-end instruments has steadily increased. While these guitars aren't cheap, buying them used offers great value for the money\\nThe other big winner right now, is the second-hand buyer. Component and shipping costs might be felt immediately in the bottom lines of guitar makers, but it takes longer for the increased prices to filter through to the used market.\\nWhat’s more, we know that when times are tight, some musicians will have to sell more instruments and buy fewer of them. This puts a downward pressure on prices, somewhat counteracting the inflationary effect.\\nWe asked Reverb.com to compare used sale price changes versus new prices, and it makes for interesting reading. Their price tracking data notes year-over-year increases of around 19% in the price of new Gibson Custom Shop Les Paul Standards and 9% in the USA Standards. In contrast, the used equivalents rose by 4% and 0%.\\nIt’s a similar story when you look at Fender. For example, Reverb’s data shows a new Custom Shop Telecaster increased in price by 20% more than the average price paid for a used equivalent.\\nAs noted previously, the higher-end guitar sales have continued to hold up well in the second-hand market, too.\\n“Compared to 2019, Reverb is now selling around 50% more used electric guitars over $1,400,” notes Cyril Nigg, Reverb's Senior Director of Analytics.\\n“And we've seen continued strong demand as the value of higher-end instruments has steadily increased. While these guitars aren't cheap, buying them used offers great value for the money.”\\nOf course, Reverb would be very enthusiastic about the merits of used purchases, and we should caveat the data by noting that the increase in higher value trades is also reflecting inflation (as rising prices result in more sales tipping over that $1,400 mark) – but we think it’s fair to say that it’s looking like a buyer’s market on the used side right now.\\nWill it go back to normal?\\nSo where do we go from here? When will things get back to normal?\\nWe’ve got good news and bad news on that front. We’ll give you the bad first: we’re highly unlikely to see prices fall in the near future.\\nThe de-globalization process is still underway, international firms of all stripes have still got to navigate shipping issues, trade tariffs, blockades, ongoing wars and all of the associated political fallout.\\nThat creates uncertainty, and businesses hate uncertainty (and, for all the legend-making, guitar-makers are businesses first and foremost).\\nAcross the board, as far as looking at it over time, we’re in a really good spot\\nThe better news is that it looks like things are beginning to settle. As this Reuter’s infographic neatly demonstrates, we’re over ‘the hump’ with inflation and the most noticeable and rapid price increases – so the sharp intakes of breath that have accompanied more recent product launches should start to lessen.\\nThere are always exceptions, but we won’t go back to 2019 prices across the board. Guitars have gotten more expensive, period. Instead we’ve hit a new plateau. A new normal. One where costs are higher, but the quality from luthiers across the world is at an all-time high and the value for money is still, historically speaking, excellent.\\nWe might have to curb our guitar-collecting habits a little (and that is probably going to be the case with a lot of our buying decisions in the next decade or two) but the geography, buying power and the ecosystem of the US economy means the glory days of the US guitar buyer are not behind us yet.\\nAs Fender’s Justin Norvell put it to us: “Across the board, as far as looking at it over time, we’re in a really good spot.”\\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month**\\nJoin now for unlimited access\\nUS pricing $3.99 per month or $39.00 per year\\nUK pricing £2.99 per month or £29.00 per year\\nEurope pricing €3.49 per month or €34.00 per year\\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\\nJoin now for unlimited access\\nPrices from £2.99/$3.99/€3.49\\nMatt is a staff writer for GuitarWorld.com.

First the guitar was stuck at customs in Rotterdam but Fender customer services sorted this with UPS. I then get a message from UPS that I need to pay £222 in Import Duty before they will deliver. So Fender happily took my money without any warning that would happen and their terms and conditions say the GBP price you see is the price you pay. Not being a savvy importer/exporter or HMRC expert, this was totally unexpected. I had to pay or no goods. Please don’t make the mistake I made. FFS don’t buy from Fender GB and source your purchases that are already physically located in the UK. In the future I would probably ring the vendor and confirm the item is in the UK. Oh and I’ll seriously be in the 💩 if I need to return it!\\nDate of experience: September 25, 2024\\nJA\\nJake 2 reviews AU\\n\\n\\nAug 9, 2024\\nI ordered a new AVII 61 Strat. ------------------------------I ordered a new AVII 61 Strat from an interstate store that came to me with some issues requiring a return and replacement. Unfortunately, the store didn\\'t have a suitable replacement available. To my surprise I was contacted by Fender who wanted to help resolve the situation. They had an excellent AVII in stock in the warehouse and working with the store they were able to sort out the return and replacement of the guitar. Throughout the process the Customer Service Representative at Fender was friendly, open to discuss the issues and ways to resolve them, quick to respond, and just generally an all-round good bloke.

Fender Jaguar, from PMT, UK, last year. Looks lovely but playability is horrible, the strings rattle and buzz (cheap feeling hardware), not something you expect for a purchase worth over a thousand pounds. After reading reviews I am not the only one who has had this problem and apparently spending money on after market parts is the way to fix it. It’s still within warranty so I emailed Fender and they told me to speak to the supplier but I can’t see them doing much as it requires more than a set-up.\\nDate of experience: February 17, 2022\\nDA\\nDavid 9 reviews GB\\n\\n\\nMar 13, 2023\\nVery poor after sales service -----------------------------Bought a Fender Mustang GT100 in May 2020.

Open? Yes! Tried to get replacement transistors and guess what? The transistors are OBSOLETE!!! Fender doesn\\'t offer a substitute either.

Its familiar yet distinctive sound sparked a journey of rediscovery that I never expected. As I delved deeper into its nuances, I uncovered a hidden gem in the world of beginner guitars that could revolutionize how we think about entry-level instruments.\\nAs the editor of ‘Acoustic Guitar’ magazine since 2014, I’ve had the privilege of testing countless guitars. The Fender Starcaster has always intrigued me for its unique position in the market. In this comprehensive review and buyer’s guide, I’ll share my insights on why this guitar might just be the perfect starting point for aspiring musicians, and how it stands up against its competitors. Join me as we explore the Starcaster’s features, sound quality, value proposition, and much more.\\nOverview of the Fender Starcaster Acoustic Guitar\\nKey Features and Design\\n \\nAs I examine the Starcaster by Fender, my years of transcribing and engraving guitar music come into play. The guitar’s dreadnought body shape immediately catches my eye, a classic choice that promises full, rich tones. Its spruce top, a hallmark of quality acoustics, is paired with laminated mahogany back and sides – a combination I’ve seen deliver impressive sound at this price point.\\nThe rosewood fingerboard feels familiar under my fingers, its smooth surface reminiscent of higher-end models I’ve analyzed. The die-cast tuners, while not top-tier, offer decent stability for beginners. What truly impresses me is the scalloped X-bracing, a feature I’ve noted in more expensive guitars, enhancing the Starcaster’s resonance and projection. This attention to detail in the internal structure speaks volumes about Fender’s commitment to quality, even in their entry-level offerings.\\nSound Quality and Performance\\n \\nAs I strum the Fender Starcaster, its warm, resonant tones immediately captivate my trained ear. The spruce top and mahogany body create a balanced sound profile, offering crisp highs and rich lows. I’m impressed by the guitar’s projection and volume, which exceed expectations for its price range. The Starcaster’s tonal clarity shines in both fingerpicking and strumming styles, making it versatile for various genres.\\nIn terms of playability, the slim neck profile and low action contribute to comfortable performance, especially for beginners. The guitar’s intonation stability is noteworthy, maintaining pitch accuracy up the fretboard. While it may not match the depth and complexity of high-end acoustics, the Starcaster’s sound quality and performance are remarkably good for its class, offering a solid foundation for aspiring musicians to develop their skills and appreciation for acoustic guitar tones.\\nValue Proposition\\nPrice Point Analysis\\n \\nAs I analyze the Starcaster by Fender price, I’m struck by its compelling value proposition. Having watched guitar prices ebb and flow over the years, I can confidently say that Fender has positioned the Starcaster at a sweet spot for beginners and budget-conscious players. The price point reflects a careful balance between affordability and quality, a hallmark of Fender’s market strategy. It’s priced competitively against other entry-level acoustics, yet it carries the weight of the Fender name, which often translates to better resale value and long-term satisfaction.\\nIn my experience, the Starcaster offers features typically found in higher-priced models, making it an exceptional value. The laminated spruce top and mahogany body, while not premium materials, provide a sound quality that punches above its price class. This guitar exemplifies how intelligent pricing can create a win-win situation for both the manufacturer and the consumer, fostering brand loyalty and encouraging musical growth.\\nComparison with Other Beginner Guitars\\n \\nAs someone who’s extensively reviewed beginner acoustic guitars, I can confidently say the Fender Starcaster holds its own against competitors. While it may not boast the richest tone or the most premium materials, it offers remarkable value for its price point. Compared to other entry-level instruments, the Starcaster’s build quality is notably superior, ensuring better durability and playability. Its sound, while not as full-bodied as higher-end models, is impressively balanced for a beginner guitar.\\nWhat truly sets the Starcaster apart is its approachability. The comfortable neck profile and low action make it easier for novices to form chords and develop proper technique. This ease of play, combined with Fender’s reputation for quality, gives beginners a solid foundation to build upon. While there are certainly flashier options available, few match the Starcaster’s combination of affordability, playability, and brand reliability, making it a standout choice in the crowded beginner guitar market.\\nExpert and User Reviews\\nProfessional Musician Opinions\\n \\nAs a seasoned music journalist, I’ve had the privilege of tapping into my network of professional musicians for their candid opinions on the Fender Starcaster. These insights offer a unique perspective on how this acoustic guitar performs in professional settings. Many praised its versatility and warm tone, noting its suitability for both studio recording and live performances. One Grammy-nominated artist remarked on its exceptional value for money, comparing it favorably to higher-end models. However, some pros mentioned that while it’s an excellent beginner to intermediate guitar, very advanced players might desire more nuanced tonal options. Overall, the consensus among professionals aligns with positive Fender acoustic guitar reviews, reinforcing the Starcaster’s reputation as a reliable instrument that punches above its weight class in terms of sound quality and playability.\\nBeginner Guitarist Experiences\\n \\nAs an author of instructional guitar books, I’ve had the privilege of guiding countless beginners on their musical journey. The Fender Starcaster has consistently emerged as a popular choice among novices. Through my interactions and feedback from students, I’ve observed that this beginner guitar offers a comfortable playing experience, crucial for newcomers. Many have shared how the Starcaster’s smooth neck and low action made their initial chord formations less daunting. The guitar’s balanced tone has also been praised for its motivational effect, encouraging consistent practice. While some found the stock strings a bit stiff, this is easily remedied and actually presents a valuable learning opportunity for string maintenance. Overall, the Starcaster has proven to be a reliable companion for those taking their first steps in guitar playing, striking a fine balance between quality and affordability that resonates well with beginners.\\nWhere to Purchase\\nOnline Retailers and Marketplaces\\n \\nAs a seasoned guitarist and industry expert, I’ve seen the online marketplace for instruments evolve dramatically. When searching for a Fender Starcaster for sale, online retailers and marketplaces offer unparalleled convenience and variety. I’ve personally purchased guitars from major e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Sweetwater, appreciating their extensive inventory and customer-friendly policies. These platforms often provide detailed product information, user reviews, and competitive pricing. Additionally, specialized music gear sites like Musician’s Friend and Guitar Center’s online store frequently stock the Starcaster, sometimes offering exclusive deals or bundles. eBay can be a treasure trove for both new and used models, but I always advise buyers to scrutinize seller ratings and item descriptions. Remember, reputable online retailers will provide manufacturer warranties and hassle-free returns, ensuring a safe purchase experience for your Fender Starcaster.\\nLocal Music Stores and Authorized Dealers\\n \\nAs a Culver City resident and guitar enthusiast, I’ve cultivated relationships with numerous local music stores over the years. These brick-and-mortar establishments offer unique advantages when shopping for a Fender Starcaster Acoustic Guitar. Authorized dealers provide the opportunity to physically inspect and play the instrument before purchase, ensuring it meets your expectations. Moreover, they often stock used Fender Starcaster Acoustic Guitars, allowing budget-conscious buyers to snag a great deal. Local stores typically offer personalized service, expert advice, and after-sale support that online retailers can’t match. They may even throw in extras like a free setup or lessons. While prices might be slightly higher than online, the ability to build a relationship with your local music community and receive hands-on assistance is invaluable, especially for beginners navigating their first guitar purchase.\\nMaintenance and Care\\nProper Storage and Transportation\\n \\nAs a gigging musician, I’ve learned that proper storage and transportation are crucial for maintaining your Fender Starcaster’s quality. While the Fender Starcaster guitar case included offers basic protection, I recommend investing in a high-quality hard case for added security. Always store your guitar in a climate-controlled environment to prevent warping and finish damage. When transporting, loosen the strings slightly to reduce tension on the neck, especially during air travel or extreme temperature changes. I always use silica gel packets in the case to combat humidity. For short trips, a padded gig bag suffices, but remember to never leave your Starcaster in a hot car. These practices have kept my guitars in top shape through countless gigs and tours, ensuring consistent performance and longevity.\\nTuning and String Maintenance\\n \\nAs a seasoned guitarist, I’ve learned that proper tuning and string maintenance are crucial for any acoustic guitar, including the Fender Starcaster. The Fender Starcaster tuners are surprisingly reliable for an entry-level instrument, but they still require regular attention. I always start by checking the tuning stability before each practice session, making minor adjustments as needed. It’s essential to stretch new strings properly to minimize future tuning issues. I’ve found that wiping down the strings after playing significantly extends their life and maintains tonal clarity. When changing strings, I take the opportunity to clean and condition the fretboard, ensuring smooth playability. Regular maintenance not only preserves your Starcaster’s sound quality but also enhances your overall playing experience, allowing you to focus on your musicianship rather than wrestling with tuning problems.\\nFAQs\\nWhat is the Fender Starcaster Acoustic Guitar?\\nThe Fender Starcaster Acoustic Guitar is an entry-level acoustic guitar produced by the renowned manufacturer Fender.

[Real Customer Ratings]\\n\\nFender, one of the most recognizable brands in guitars, enjoys an enviable reputation for its iconic range of electric guitars and amplifiers. But, how do guitarists feel about their acoustic models?\\nFender acoustic guitars are good for beginners and compare favorably to guitars of a similarly affordable price from brands such as Yamaha, Cort, and Alvarez. Unlike their range of electric guitars, Fender acoustic guitars are affordably priced due to being manufactured offshore, with the exception of their Acoustisonic series being made entirely in the US.\\nBut, don’t just take my word for it.\\nIn the following article, we’re going to take a closer look at Fender’s acoustic guitar range, and how customers who have bought their guitars genuinely feel about them.\\nWe’ve collected customer ratings from Amazon, Sweetwater, Guitar Center, Musicians Friend, and Reverb.com\\xa0and compiled an average customer rating for each popular model Fender offers.\\nSo, if you’re looking for a completely unbiased opinion on Fender acoustic guitars, stay tuned!\\xa0But first…\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nWhat Makes A Good Acoustic Guitar?\\nFender Acoustic Guitars – Current Range\\nFender California Series\\nFender Paramount Series\\nFender Classic Design Series\\nFender Alternative series\\nFender Artist Design Series\\nFender American Acoustasonic series\\nAre Fender Acoustic Guitars Good?

But, that misses the point as Fender hasn’t intentionally targeted this type of player.\\nTherefore, to give a verdict on Fender acoustic guitars we really need to take the opinions of actual buyers who own Fender acoustic guitars.\\n\\nFender Acoustic Guitars – Current Range\\nFender offers a fairly broad range of acoustic guitars.

17% during the pandemic and are expected to top $700 million this year as housebound consumers look for new hobbies, says Fender Musical Instruments Corp. CEO Andy Mooney.\\nThe company\\'s online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele, is helping to drive consumer interest in the brand.\\nThis fall it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses.\\n\\nFender Musical Instruments\\' CEO Andy Mooney says a boom in guitar sales is happening during the coronavirus pandemic.\\nHenry Diltz\\nBusiness was looking pretty grim for Fender Musical Instruments Corp., the legendary guitar maker, when the coronavirus pandemic reached U.S. shores last March. Suddenly, 90% of its worldwide dealers\\' physical stores closed, as did many of its online sellers\\' distribution centers. Fender\\'s factories in Corona, California, and Ensenada, Mexico, shut down, furloughing hundreds of employees. Its headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, shuttered, as did its Hollywood hub, where CEO Andy Mooney and his management team work.\\n\"We were looking over the edge of an abyss, frankly, and went into company preservation mode,\" Mooney told CNBC in late October, while still running things from his home in L.A. after summering in Long Island. He and every other one of Fender\\'s roughly 2,000 employees took up to 50% pay cuts. \"We just tightened our belt.\"\\nWell, in the topsy-turvy world that Covid-19 has wrought, Fender\\'s bad fortunes have since turned upside down — to the merry melody of record-setting sales, estimated by Mooney to top $700 million this year, rising nearly 17% from last year\\'s more than $600 million. \"We are anticipating 2021 being another record year,\" he predicted, \"no matter how the pandemic plays out.\"\\nGuitar sales explode during pandemic\\nAs much pain as the pandemic initially inflicted upon Fender, the virus has also produced a balm. The turnaround actually began in late March with what Mooney describes as \"purely a goodwill gesture\" to the unexpectedly housebound public looking to take up hobbies other than baking bread and riding bikes. The company offered Fender Play, the online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele introduced in July 2017, free for 90 days to the first 100,000 subscribers.\\nFender hit that mark the very first day, reached a half million sign-ups the first week and settled at about 930,000 subscribers by June. Nearly 20% of the newcomers were under 24, and 70% were under 45, the company reported. Female users accounted for 45% of the new wave, compared with 30% before the pandemic. \"I never would have possibly predicted that,\" Mooney said, noting that the same offer has been extended to the end of this year.\\nSimultaneously, Fender saw sales of Stratocasters, Telecasters, Jazzmasters, Precision basses and other iconic electric guitar models surge, along with orders for acoustic guitars, ukuleles, amplifiers, home-recording equipment and other gear. Fender models selling for under $500 grew 92% from mid-March to mid-October; most were acoustic guitars bought online by beginners. More experienced players go for pricier electric guitars, ranging from an entry-level Strat for around $700 to an Acoustasonic for $3,300.\\nWhen Fender reopened the factories in April, it rehired laid-off workers and added extra shifts to keep up with demand. Plus, it had ample inventory to support the flood of online sales among its U.S. network of about 1,000 authorized dealers. \"Our distribution centers, owned by third parties, never closed, even as dealers\\' did,\" Mooney explained. \"We shipped product directly to consumers on their behalf.\" Most Fender branded guitars are manufactured in Corona and Ensenada, though some are produced in Japan and Southeast Asia.\\nBesides its own e-commerce operation — accelerated since Mooney was hired in 2015 — Fender sells online through pure-play instrument e-tailers such as Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Sweetwater and Thomann, headquartered in Germany, as well as Amazon, Walmart and Target. Pre-Covid, half of Fender\\'s sales were online, Mooney said, and have since swelled to 70%.\\n\"At Sweetwater, we are seeing 50% to 100% year-over-year growth across most guitar brands, both acoustic and electric guitars, and at all price points,\" said Mike Clem, the website\\'s chief digital officer. \"Some beginner instruments are seeing triple-digit YOY growth.\"\\nMusic buffs take up guitar-playing\\nFender, founded in 1946 by radio repairman turned guitar inventor Leo Fender in Fullerton, California, still relies on hundreds of bricks-and-mortar music stores, a key gateway to the brand ubiquitous among rock and rollers past and present, including Buddy Holly, Dick Dale, Bonnie Raitt, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Susan Tedeschi and John Mayer.\\nGuitar Center, a prominent Fender seller based in Westlake Village, California, closed most of its nearly 300 locations when the pandemic hit. \"We saw a shift of consumers to our e-commerce channels,\" said Michael Doyle, senior vice president, guitar and tech merchandising. That translated to a triple-digit sales growth for Fender and other top guitar brands on its website, particularly among new strummers.\\n\"Covid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner player,\" Doyle added. \"In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack,\" featuring a Squier Stratocaster electric guitar and Frontman amp for $220. (Nonetheless, Guitar Center, the nation\\'s largest musical instrument retailer — which generated $2.3 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year, but is mired in about $1.3 billion in debt — missed a $45-million interest payment last month and filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 13 concurrent with a debt restructuring plan, with the hope of balancing its books by early next year and its business operations continuing uninterrupted.)\\nWhile the pandemic played havoc with Fender\\'s 2020, the company has been steadily retuning its marketing strategy under Mooney, who previously boosted brands for Quiksilver, Disney and Nike. Another Nike alumnus, Evan Jones, was hired as Fender\\'s first-ever chief marketing officer around the same time Mooney arrived. \"The company has shifted from trade-based to consumer-based marketing,\" Jones said. \"We\\'ve built a full-fledged, integrated organization that allows us to invest in community-building through social channels, CRM and a visual ecosystem.\"\\n\\nCovid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner [guitar] player. In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack.\\nMichael Doyle\\nsenior vice president, Guitar Center\\n\\nThat organization — along with Fender\\'s design and production operations — was put to the test in October when it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses. Fender hired Wieden+Kennedy, known for its Nike ads, to work alongside its in-house creative team to develop a campaign dubbed \"For One. For All.\" The launch included producing videos starring 20 professional guitarists playing the new models and heralding their improvements. \"They\\'re able to articulate what the instruments do as well as or better than any product reviews,\" Jones maintained.\\nChurning out new products\\nThe design process for the new series began more than two years ago, said Justin Norvell, executive vice president of products. \"We talked to players, beginners to pros, to figure out what drives them, inspires them, what they\\'re looking for,\" he said. So, while the new Strat, Telecaster and other updated models look like their classic selves, changes were made to the necks, fingerboards and pickups to improve sound and feel. \"A lot of that comes down to manufacturing technology and quality control to create instruments that are easier to play,\" Norvell said.\\nNorvell coordinated that effort with Fender\\'s executive vice president of operations, Ed Magee, who was challenged with gearing up the factories after the pandemic shutdowns. \"We brought back most of the furloughed employees,\" he said, and reconfigured workstations to allow for social distancing. \"We had to source masks and other PPE,\" he added. \"We had to innovate on the fly, but worker safety comes first.\"\\nThe culmination of the design and production efforts is when a guitarist straps on a Fender, like the new Acoustasonic Strat Nile Rodgers recently got his hands on. A Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, he and his bandmate, the late bassist Bernard Edwards, created a funky disco sound in the early 1970s that defined an entire era with enduring hits like \"Good Times\" and \"Le Freak.\"\\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Nile Rodgers is developing a different sound on the Fender Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid.\\nFender Musical Instruments\\nRodgers still plays the white 1960 Strat, nicknamed the Hitmaker, that he traded for at a pawn shop in Hialeah, Florida, in 1973, but is developing a different sound on the Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid. \"When I got the instrument, I started practicing on it and came up with a whole new concept,\" he said. The result is heard on a song, \"Inside the Box,\" and video he made with Fender, highlighting the instrument\\'s multiple voice pairings.\\nThe experience has inspired Rodgers to practice relentlessly and compose dozens of new songs while locked down at home in Westport, Connecticut. \"I made a promise to myself — I\\'m 68 now — that by the time I\\'m 69, I\\'m going to be a better guitar player.\"\\nKatie Pruitt, 26, an up-and-coming country/folk/pop vocalist and guitarist and songwriter, is a comparative neophyte whose mother introduced her to the guitar as a kid growing up outside of Atlanta. \"She played in our church, and I learned basic chords from her,\" Pruitt said. She kept at it through high school and joined a band while attending Belmont University in Nashville, where she now lives and makes music.\\nPruitt\\'s parents bought her a Strat she still plays, \"and I got a Jazzmaster that I also used in making \\'Expectations,\\'\" she said, referring to her debut album, released in February. She promotes both the record and the Jazzmaster, among the American Professional II models, in a \"Fender Sessions\" video, featuring the title song, made with her current band. Like so many musicians whose live concerts have been canceled during the pandemic, Pruitt has been using the at-home time to work on new material. \"My mind is fully submerged into writing a second record,\" she said.\\nFender helps spawn new artists like Katie Pruitt, an up-and-coming songwriter and vocalist.\\nMichael Weintrob\\nWhile Fender may well help spawn new artists from the beginners taking its online lessons and buying its instruments in droves, Mooney said research revealed that \"90% of first-time players who pick up the guitar abandon it in the first year.\" But on the flip side of that sharp drop off, he added, the 10% who remain committed buy several more guitars. \"They have a lifetime value of $10,000,\" he calculated, \"and that\\'s a $1 billion bubble on top of sustainable, organic growth.\"\\nNo wonder Mooney is optimistic about not only Fender\\'s future, but that of the entire fretted instruments industry — which last year topped $8 billion, according to research organization Music Trades — that it dominates. \"I keep reminding people that we\\'re a growth company operating in a growth industry.\"\\nThe pandemic has changed the way people create and consume content and access entertainment.

As a former guitar teacher I've been immersed in the world of music for years. It's this passion and enthusiasm about all things guitar that drove me to start this website. A place where I could talk about the gear, techniques and general awesomeness that is the best instrument.\\nI began playing somewhat late compared to a lot of people. I was 15 years old as it had taken me a while to find the confidence to believe in myself and take that step to learn to play an instrument. It started my lifelong love of music and playing in general. Since then like so many before me I've become an addict and gone through more guitars, amps and gear than I care to remember.\\nI taught guitar for some time but unfortunately was forced to stop due to ill health. This lead to me starting this website so I could still share my love for and what I've learnt about the guitar.

The Highway Series is clearly aimed at players who are hybrid curious but want something more along the lines of a traditional acoustic than Fender’s groundbreaking, yet polarizing, Acoustasonic Series.\\nHighway Series guitars are thinline acoustics featuring a specially designed Fishman Fluence Acoustic magnetic soundhole pickup. They promise electric playability with acoustic tone via a more straightforward and streamlined system than the DSP-driven Acoustasonic, at a nicer price point and with a more conventional aesthetic.\\nThe Highway Series consists of two models, Parlor and Dreadnought, each available in mahogany or mahogany with a solid Sitka spruce top. Our review units were an all-mahogany Dreadnought and a spruce-topped Parlor.\\nAll Highway Series guitars have the iconic Fender six-in-line headstock design, and a more traditional look from the neck down. A Fishman Fluence Acoustic pickup is stealthily tucked up near the top of the neck, with a curve that follows the lip of the soundhole. The volume and tone knobs are the only other obvious indication of a hybrid design.\\nTo my eyes, the all-mahogany Dreadnought appeared almost too plain, while the natural spruce top with checkered rosette and top binding brightened up and nicely highlighted the Parlor.\\nInterestingly, there’s no indication of the Highway Series or a model designation anywhere. The headstock simply has the Fender logo etched into the wood. A plaque on the back indicates an origin of Ensenada, Mexico. Craftsmanship on both guitars was smooth and blemish free, which is especially impressive given the price of about a grand.\\n\\nThe Fluence Acoustic magnetic pickup uses analog technology to deliver pure amplified tone (Image credit: Fender)\\nBoth instruments feel comfortable, with beveled arm rests and contoured backs. The fully chambered bodies measure a mere 2.25 inches deep, just slightly thicker than a typical solidbody Strat. For that matter, the bolt-on C-shaped neck measures a mere 1.69 inches wide at the nut and feels more like an electric, even if the frets are narrower and taller than the jumbo frets often found on a Strat.\\nThe Parlor and the Dreadnought are lightweight and ergonomic, and that’s especially awesome when playing standing up.\\nGetting the slightly lower action I prefer was easily achieved with a quick turn of the truss rod via the included hex wrench. The extra-light phosphor-bronze strings deliver an acoustic feel to the otherwise electric-like situation. Fender nailed the best-of-both-worlds target on both instruments.\\nThe playability is wonderfully easy, yet still authentically acoustic enough to feel appropriate for fingerpicking as well as plectrum playing. True to their body styles, the Dreadnought is a natural strummer, while the Parlor is more organically suited to fingerpicking.\\n\\nFishman designed the Fluence Acoustic pickup specifically to give the Fender Highway Series a uniquely natural acoustic electric signal, and they hit the bull’s-eye (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe Highway Series exists in its own lane sonically. These guitars aren’t going to win any campfire competitions, but they do deliver enough acoustic oomph to work well in a van, a hotel room or backstage, and they are significantly more full and natural sounding than an Acoustasonic.\\nBoth feature a tapered floating X bracing pattern that seems to bring out plenty of top resonance. Obviously, the Dreadnought, with its bigger body, delivers more boom than the Parlor, and in the case of our review units, the mahogany top on the Dreadnought gave it a balmier wooden quality, while the spruce-top Parlor had more articulation.\\nPrimarily designed to be plugged in, both guitars came into their own when coupled with amplification. They sounded remarkably large even when run through the 100-watt Fender Acoustic Junior GO, with its eight-inch woofer, and then went up to a whole other level when run through the Acoustasonic setting on the new Tone Master Pro coupled with the 1,000-watt Fender FR-12 powered 1x12 cabinet. Talk about a huge acoustic stage sound! I was able to crank up with zero feedback.\\nFishman designed the Fluence Acoustic pickup specifically to give the Fender Highway Series a uniquely natural acoustic-electric signal, and they hit the bull’s-eye. These magnetic pickups have none of the quackiness associated with traditional piezo undersaddle pickups, and they don’t suffer from the somewhat dull, midrange focus associated with most magnetic soundhole designs.\\n\\nThe binding is especially pretty on the paler, two-tone Parlor (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe tone is beefy in the bottom and balanced in the middle, with a nice top-end sparkle. The curved pickup is located up near the top of the neck, so the sound certainly has the throatiness of a neck pickup.\\nIf you feel the tone has too much junk in the trunk, you can roll it back via the contour knob from the full-boded sound of Voice 1 to the tighter, more mid- and top-focused Voice 2, for more clarity and articulation that sits better in a band mix.\\nThe only thing I found missing was a strong sense of percussiveness from the top, the kind that the middle position on the Acoustasonic Series delivers in spades. It would be cool if Fender and Fishman could incorporate that into future designs, and I’ll bet they will.\\nThe bottom line is that the Highway Series is an excellent crossover option for players who want a killer acoustic stage sound from an instrument with the comfort and playability of an electric guitar.\\n\\nThe stylish volume and tone knobs are identically placed on both models (Image credit: Fender)\\nThe aesthetic is still traditional enough that most onlookers wouldn’t think to look twice, yet it has enough of a modern hybrid vibe that folks who have any musical sense will likely do a double take.\\nWhether you choose the Dreadnought or Parlor is a matter of personal preference. Whichever you select, both instruments deliver excellent playability and tone.\\nYou’re not supposed to be able to conjure an authentic acoustic sound from such thin bodies, but Fender and Fishman have found an analog way forward, free from the worries of digital component durability.\\nFor continuing to break new ground while maintaining mass appeal and attainability, both Highway Series guitars earn an Editors’ Pick Award.\\nSpecifications (Dreadnought)\\n\\nNUT WIDTH 1.69”, Tush\\xa0\\nNECK Mahogany, 12” radius\\xa0\\nFRETBOARD Indian rosewood, 25.5” scale\\xa0\\nFRETS 20, narrow tall\\xa0\\nTUNERS Fender ClassicGear\\xa0\\nBODY Thinline tapered dreadnought.

With its slab body, bolt-on neck, simple electronics and trem-free bridge, it’s about as route-one an electric guitar as you can imagine – but as countless icons can attest, a good one will take you all the way to the top and never complain.\\n\\nREAD MORE: Fender Player II Jazzmaster review – the new king of affordable offsets?\\n\\nThe first rung on that ladder, in Fender terms at least, is the Player series – the Big F’s most affordable Mexico-made instrument line, and arguably its most important given that it is a gateway guitar to a world of Vinteras, AVs, AmPros, Ultras and beyond.\\nEarlier this year, Fender overhauled the Player range in the shape of the Player II – refining and enhancing what was already a very well thought of line to make it an even more enticing proposition for those of us shopping in the always competitive sub-$1,000 guitar market.\\nThe Player II Telecaster is, inevitably, going to be one of the most popular guitars in the range – the Tele remains a hugely popular choice with players young and old, despite the rise and rise of the upstart offset. Let’s see what it has to offer…\\n\\nImage: Adam Gasson\\nHow is the Player II Telecaster different from the Player I?\\nI covered a fair bit of this ground in my review of the Player II Strat a few months back, but to reiterate – most of the fundamental stuff here is not dramatically different. You still get a gloss-finished alder body, maple neck with 9.5” radius and the same Player Series Alnico V pickups, Tele bridge and control layout. None of that stuff was broke on the original Player so why change it?\\nWhat you do get are some small but fairly important differences, most of which are focused on the neck. So, for starters the neck of this very 70s-vibed 3TSB Player II guitar has a rosewood fingerboard as opposed to the pau ferro that non-maple board Player I guitars had. It looks nicer, it plays nicer, it’s what everyone wants – nice. There’s also a nice tint to the maple on the neck here that addresses the slightly anaemic look of the original Player guitars. It’s not so dark as to look brown, but it elevates the whole vibe above the ‘cheap Ikea furniture’ look that often plagues the maple on more affordable instruments. As with the Player I, the maple is gloss-finished on the front of the headstock, but satin on the back – a nice player-centric touch.\\nPerhaps the most important change to the neck can be found at the edges of the fingerboard. As with the Player Plus guitars launched a few years back, all Player II guitars now have rolled fingerboard edges as standard – where the square edges of the ‘board itself are gently sanded to be more rounded and, so the theory goes, more comfortable to play.\\n\\nImage: Adam Gasson\\nThere are some other changes of course. You get a bunch of new finishes, and some tweaks to the formula – most notable replacing the bent steel saddles for block steel ones. Tele purists will bemoan the fact that they’re not brass barrel types – for many players it’s an essential component of the recipe – but the block saddles are probably a decent compromise of mass versus easy intonation tweakability.\\nOne other thing to note is the case, or lack thereof. Fender’s so-called ‘Deluxe’ gigbag has been a cheap and not particularly cheerful misnomer for some time, but rather than give us something better this time, it’s been done away with altogether.\\nThis is no doubt done to keep the costs down (and in fairness to Fender the Player II guitars don’t cost much more than the Player Is did this time last year) and of all the compromises they could have made, it’s probably the most tolerable. I won’t miss the gigbag, but I can also imagine a situation where a kid has saved up just enough to buy themselves their first real Fender guitar and the reality that they’ve gotta stump up and extra $50 just to get the thing home safely might be a bit of a shock, so worth knowing.\\n\\nImage: Adam Gasson\\nDoes the Player II Telecaster play well?\\nThere are some people who don’t like rolled fingerboard edges as they seem to think it creates extra space between the board and hand which can lead to fatigue when playing for long periods of time. Those people are, frankly, wrong. Particularly at this sort of price point, the transformative effect of rolled edges on your playing experience simply cannot be understated. It effectively does the job of 20 years of hard-gigging right out of the box, and when most people talk about how vintage guitars ‘feel’ better than modern ones, that’s a big part of what they mean.\\nFender Mexico’s QC has not always been spotless in the last few years – particularly in terms of set-ups – so it’s a relief to find that this is a very well-sorted guitar. All six strings vibrate freely without buzzing, and there’s no solo-ruining choking to be found.\\nMy only real issue is an action that’s a little bit on the high side – this wasn’t the case with any other Player II guitars I’ve had in for test so far, and it’s not so bad that you feel like you’re diving off the high board every time you fret a note, but it’s not as slinky as I’d like. A quick check of the neck relief indicates that it’s not a truss rod issue, but it is a little higher at the 17th fret than the 1.6mm Fender expects for a 9.5” radius guitar. A quick tweak of the saddles with a hex key seems to sort that out with minimal fuss.\\n\\nImage: Adam Gasson\\nDoes the Player II Telecaster sound good?\\nGiven that most of the changes and tweaks to the playability side of things, it’s not a surprise that things are broadly in line with the previous Player incarnation. That’s no bad thing of course – the neck pickup is vocal and expressive, while there’s much fun to be had with the bridge unit too. It’s clear but not brittle and delivers a range of classic Telecaster tones with pleasing jangle, snap and snarl in both the in-between and pure bridge selector options.\\nIf the rosewood board is making a difference sonically, I can’t hear it – but it looks and feels lovely in the hand, and that’s what’s really important, surely\\nShould I buy a Fender Player II Telecaster?\\nDo you like Telecasters? Do you like guitars that play and sound good? Do you have a relatively limited budget? If your answer to any combination of those three questions is yes, then honestly get that credit card out right now and don’t delay. There was pretty much nothing wrong with the Player I Telecaster, but the Player II has enhanced and improved an already good guitar and made it great – a workhorse that takes the load in so many ways.\\nFender Player II Telecaster alternatives\\nIf you want something that’s a little more vintage-correct, the Vintera II 60s Telecaster ($1,149/£999/99) is a beautiful beast of a thing, while at the other end of the scale, Squier’s Classic Vibe ’60s Custom Telecaster ($449/£379) is a whole lot of guitar for the money. If you want Tele sounds but not Tele looks, the new Squier Paranormal Offset Telecaster SJ ($449/£419.99) offers a wonderful mix of Jazzmaster and Tele in a beautiful package.\\nRelated Brands\\nFender\\nRelated Tags\\n#Electric Guitars#Telecaster\\nTrending Now\\n1\\n### Neural DSP Nano Cortex review – the last pedalboard amp you’ll ever need?\\n2\\n### Amyl and The Sniffers are ready to take on all comers\\n3\\n### Where NOT to get Elton John to sign your guitar – Nashville’s Sam Palladio shows off his Gibson acoustics\\n4\\n### Learn all about the Martin Artist Showcase class of 2024\\nJoin Our Mailing List & Get Exclusive DealsSign Up Now\\n\\nThe world’s leading authority and resource for all things guitar.\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCookie Notice\\nTerms of use\\nAdvertise\\nContact\\n© 2024 Guitar.com is part of NME Networks.', 'https://www.guitarplayer.com/reviews/fender-noventa-stratocaster-review': 'Fender Noventa Stratocaster Review | GuitarPlayer\\nSkip to main content\\nOpen menu Close menu\\nGuitarPlayer\\nSearch\\nSearch GuitarPlayer \\n\\n\\n\\nNews\\nPlayers\\nLessons\\nGear\\nReviews\\nSubscribe\\nStore\\nAbout Us\\n\\nTrending\\n\\nNew EVH Frankenstein mini-doc\\nWin tickets to see Al Di Meola\\n\\nThe guitars David Gilmour would never sell\\n\\n\\nReviews\\n\\n\\nFender Noventa Stratocaster Review\\nThis streamlined Strat has a lot of tonal vibe, and it’s a gas to play.\\nBy Art Thompson\\nlast updated 13 May 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

But the pickups haven’t been offered on recent production-line S and T models until the Noventa series Telecaster, Stratocaster, and Jazzmaster landed in 2021 (accompanied by the Player Mustang 90). All feature Fender Noventa single-coils – one, two and three respectively – as well as other elements that make them quite different animals from their classic-style counterparts.\\n\\n(Image credit: FMIC)\\nThe Crimson Red Transparent Strat on review here immediately gets the point across when you see its twin pickups, truncated control complement (two knobs and a three-way selector) and a chrome-plated hardtail bridge on which the strings load Tele-style into metal ferrules on the back.\\nThe bolt-on maple neck has a very smooth satin finish and is carved into what Fender calls its Modern C profile, an inviting shape that practically begs you to play for long stretches. The striped, pau-ferro fingerboard carries 21 nicely crowned medium-jumbo frets that are trimmed on the ends for a smooth ride when sliding along the fretboard, and the synthetic bone nut received similar attention, so that it feels like part of the neck – only the top corners of the nut are a little sharp. The spot-on factory setup provides excellent playability and practically zero string buzz, and the intonation is tunefully accurate. At 7.28 pounds the guitar feels light and nimble.\\n\\n(Image credit: FMIC)\\nThe tightly coupled components, not to mention the absence of a vibrato system with its springs, claw and inertia block, help make the guitar sound resonant and sustaining when played acoustically, and those traits remained front and center when plugged into a Fender Deluxe Reverb, a Tone Master Super Reverb or a Victoria Double Deluxe 2x12 combo.\\nThe Noventa is louder and meatier than a standard Strat, and it also reminded us a bit of the Reverend Gristle 90 in the sense that the bridge position is girthy sounding and has that slightly quacky-but-cutting texture that makes a good P-90 so cool for lead playing. The Noventa pickups also sound great combined for a full, crisp tone that’s less biting than the bridge pickup by itself, and the neck position is balanced and has plenty of top-end for solos, yet easily cops a cool jazz vibe with a downward twist of the tone knob.\\n\\n(Image credit: FMIC)\\nThis streamlined Strat has a lot of tonal vibe, and it’s a gas to play thanks to its nice setup and overall attention to detail. As a do-it-all guitar that can cover a lot of bases, the Noventa Strat delivers a lot of bang for the buck and could easily be a go-to axe for players who gig in a variety of situations and need one guitar that can do it all. In fact, in many ways this new Fender fills that need, just like the original. However, as the Noventa aptly demonstrates, less can be more when it comes to the Stratocaster.\\nSpecifications:\\n\\nBUILT Mexico\\nNUT WIDTH 1.650” synthetic bone\\nNECK Maple, bolt-on.

These factors will continue to bode well for the segment during the forecast period.\\n\\nThe offline segment retained a large market in terms of share and is expected to develop at a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period. The retail store offers various brands with a variety of guitars. After the lockdowns were gradually lifted in various countries across the globe, guitar sales via offline stores increased. For instance, according to a blog published by Guitar.com, the iconic Guitar Center store on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California saw a triple-digit jump in sales in August 2020 (compared to August 2019), which the company attributed to a rise in amateur musicians and podcasters buying gear to utilize while in lockdown for COVID-19. Therefore, the offline segment accounted for large revenue in 2022.\\nRegional Insights\\nNorth America is anticipated to develop at the fastest CAGR of 8.3% during the forecast period. This is due to the growing concept of live music in connection with the growing number of music concerts in the U.S. Michael Kelly Guitar Co. and others are introducing new variants to attract the largest customer base in the region. Moreover, several major manufacturers such as Gibson Brands, Inc.; Fender Musical Instruments; and Yamaha Corporation are launching innovative variants to penetrate further into the market. These factors are expected to drive the market growth throughout the forecast period.\\n\\nAsia Pacific accounted for the highest market share of more than 45.0% in 2022. The presence of the largest musical instrument manufacturers, including China and India, is a key factor driving the market growth. China hosts one of the largest international trade fairs for musical instruments. These huge trade fairs pave the way for musical instruments, including electric guitars. These factors are driving demand for electric guitars in the region. Thus, the region has accounted for a large revenue generation in 2022.\\nKey Companies & Market Share Insights\\nKey manufacturers are majorly focusing on rapidly changing consumer preferences so that market demand can be capitalized.

guitar sales have grown 17% during the pandemic and are expected to top $700 million this year as housebound consumers look for new hobbies, says Fender Musical Instruments Corp. CEO Andy Mooney.\\nThe company\\'s online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele, is helping to drive consumer interest in the brand.\\nThis fall it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses.\\n\\nFender Musical Instruments\\' CEO Andy Mooney says a boom in guitar sales is happening during the coronavirus pandemic.\\nHenry Diltz\\nBusiness was looking pretty grim for Fender Musical Instruments Corp., the legendary guitar maker, when the coronavirus pandemic reached U.S. shores last March. Suddenly, 90% of its worldwide dealers\\' physical stores closed, as did many of its online sellers\\' distribution centers. Fender\\'s factories in Corona, California, and Ensenada, Mexico, shut down, furloughing hundreds of employees. Its headquarters in Scottsdale, Arizona, shuttered, as did its Hollywood hub, where CEO Andy Mooney and his management team work.\\n\"We were looking over the edge of an abyss, frankly, and went into company preservation mode,\" Mooney told CNBC in late October, while still running things from his home in L.A. after summering in Long Island. He and every other one of Fender\\'s roughly 2,000 employees took up to 50% pay cuts. \"We just tightened our belt.\"\\nWell, in the topsy-turvy world that Covid-19 has wrought, Fender\\'s bad fortunes have since turned upside down — to the merry melody of record-setting sales, estimated by Mooney to top $700 million this year, rising nearly 17% from last year\\'s more than $600 million. \"We are anticipating 2021 being another record year,\" he predicted, \"no matter how the pandemic plays out.\"\\nGuitar sales explode during pandemic\\nAs much pain as the pandemic initially inflicted upon Fender, the virus has also produced a balm. The turnaround actually began in late March with what Mooney describes as \"purely a goodwill gesture\" to the unexpectedly housebound public looking to take up hobbies other than baking bread and riding bikes. The company offered Fender Play, the online video platform for learning guitar, bass and ukulele introduced in July 2017, free for 90 days to the first 100,000 subscribers.\\nFender hit that mark the very first day, reached a half million sign-ups the first week and settled at about 930,000 subscribers by June. Nearly 20% of the newcomers were under 24, and 70% were under 45, the company reported. Female users accounted for 45% of the new wave, compared with 30% before the pandemic. \"I never would have possibly predicted that,\" Mooney said, noting that the same offer has been extended to the end of this year.\\nSimultaneously, Fender saw sales of Stratocasters, Telecasters, Jazzmasters, Precision basses and other iconic electric guitar models surge, along with orders for acoustic guitars, ukuleles, amplifiers, home-recording equipment and other gear. Fender models selling for under $500 grew 92% from mid-March to mid-October; most were acoustic guitars bought online by beginners. More experienced players go for pricier electric guitars, ranging from an entry-level Strat for around $700 to an Acoustasonic for $3,300.\\nWhen Fender reopened the factories in April, it rehired laid-off workers and added extra shifts to keep up with demand. Plus, it had ample inventory to support the flood of online sales among its U.S. network of about 1,000 authorized dealers. \"Our distribution centers, owned by third parties, never closed, even as dealers\\' did,\" Mooney explained. \"We shipped product directly to consumers on their behalf.\" Most Fender branded guitars are manufactured in Corona and Ensenada, though some are produced in Japan and Southeast Asia.\\nBesides its own e-commerce operation — accelerated since Mooney was hired in 2015 — Fender sells online through pure-play instrument e-tailers such as Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Sweetwater and Thomann, headquartered in Germany, as well as Amazon, Walmart and Target. Pre-Covid, half of Fender\\'s sales were online, Mooney said, and have since swelled to 70%.\\n\"At Sweetwater, we are seeing 50% to 100% year-over-year growth across most guitar brands, both acoustic and electric guitars, and at all price points,\" said Mike Clem, the website\\'s chief digital officer. \"Some beginner instruments are seeing triple-digit YOY growth.\"\\nMusic buffs take up guitar-playing\\nFender, founded in 1946 by radio repairman turned guitar inventor Leo Fender in Fullerton, California, still relies on hundreds of bricks-and-mortar music stores, a key gateway to the brand ubiquitous among rock and rollers past and present, including Buddy Holly, Dick Dale, Bonnie Raitt, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Eddie Van Halen, Susan Tedeschi and John Mayer.\\nGuitar Center, a prominent Fender seller based in Westlake Village, California, closed most of its nearly 300 locations when the pandemic hit. \"We saw a shift of consumers to our e-commerce channels,\" said Michael Doyle, senior vice president, guitar and tech merchandising. That translated to a triple-digit sales growth for Fender and other top guitar brands on its website, particularly among new strummers.\\n\"Covid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner player,\" Doyle added. \"In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack,\" featuring a Squier Stratocaster electric guitar and Frontman amp for $220. (Nonetheless, Guitar Center, the nation\\'s largest musical instrument retailer — which generated $2.3 billion in sales in its most recent fiscal year, but is mired in about $1.3 billion in debt — missed a $45-million interest payment last month and filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 13 concurrent with a debt restructuring plan, with the hope of balancing its books by early next year and its business operations continuing uninterrupted.)\\nWhile the pandemic played havoc with Fender\\'s 2020, the company has been steadily retuning its marketing strategy under Mooney, who previously boosted brands for Quiksilver, Disney and Nike. Another Nike alumnus, Evan Jones, was hired as Fender\\'s first-ever chief marketing officer around the same time Mooney arrived. \"The company has shifted from trade-based to consumer-based marketing,\" Jones said. \"We\\'ve built a full-fledged, integrated organization that allows us to invest in community-building through social channels, CRM and a visual ecosystem.\"\\n\\nCovid buying trends have re-emphasized the importance of the beginner [guitar] player. In fact, we expect that one of our hottest deals of the holidays will be a Guitar Center exclusive entry-level Fender Guitar Pack.\\nMichael Doyle\\nsenior vice president, Guitar Center\\n\\nThat organization — along with Fender\\'s design and production operations — was put to the test in October when it introduced the American Professional II series, the second generation of its flagship electric guitars and basses. Fender hired Wieden+Kennedy, known for its Nike ads, to work alongside its in-house creative team to develop a campaign dubbed \"For One. For All.\" The launch included producing videos starring 20 professional guitarists playing the new models and heralding their improvements. \"They\\'re able to articulate what the instruments do as well as or better than any product reviews,\" Jones maintained.\\nChurning out new products\\nThe design process for the new series began more than two years ago, said Justin Norvell, executive vice president of products. \"We talked to players, beginners to pros, to figure out what drives them, inspires them, what they\\'re looking for,\" he said. So, while the new Strat, Telecaster and other updated models look like their classic selves, changes were made to the necks, fingerboards and pickups to improve sound and feel. \"A lot of that comes down to manufacturing technology and quality control to create instruments that are easier to play,\" Norvell said.\\nNorvell coordinated that effort with Fender\\'s executive vice president of operations, Ed Magee, who was challenged with gearing up the factories after the pandemic shutdowns. \"We brought back most of the furloughed employees,\" he said, and reconfigured workstations to allow for social distancing. \"We had to source masks and other PPE,\" he added. \"We had to innovate on the fly, but worker safety comes first.\"\\nThe culmination of the design and production efforts is when a guitarist straps on a Fender, like the new Acoustasonic Strat Nile Rodgers recently got his hands on. A Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, he and his bandmate, the late bassist Bernard Edwards, created a funky disco sound in the early 1970s that defined an entire era with enduring hits like \"Good Times\" and \"Le Freak.\"\\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Nile Rodgers is developing a different sound on the Fender Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid.\\nFender Musical Instruments\\nRodgers still plays the white 1960 Strat, nicknamed the Hitmaker, that he traded for at a pawn shop in Hialeah, Florida, in 1973, but is developing a different sound on the Acoustasonic, an acoustic and electric hybrid. \"When I got the instrument, I started practicing on it and came up with a whole new concept,\" he said. The result is heard on a song, \"Inside the Box,\" and video he made with Fender, highlighting the instrument\\'s multiple voice pairings.\\nThe experience has inspired Rodgers to practice relentlessly and compose dozens of new songs while locked down at home in Westport, Connecticut. \"I made a promise to myself — I\\'m 68 now — that by the time I\\'m 69, I\\'m going to be a better guitar player.\"\\nKatie Pruitt, 26, an up-and-coming country/folk/pop vocalist and guitarist and songwriter, is a comparative neophyte whose mother introduced her to the guitar as a kid growing up outside of Atlanta. \"She played in our church, and I learned basic chords from her,\" Pruitt said. She kept at it through high school and joined a band while attending Belmont University in Nashville, where she now lives and makes music.\\nPruitt\\'s parents bought her a Strat she still plays, \"and I got a Jazzmaster that I also used in making \\'Expectations,\\'\" she said, referring to her debut album, released in February. She promotes both the record and the Jazzmaster, among the American Professional II models, in a \"Fender Sessions\" video, featuring the title song, made with her current band. Like so many musicians whose live concerts have been canceled during the pandemic, Pruitt has been using the at-home time to work on new material. \"My mind is fully submerged into writing a second record,\" she said.\\nFender helps spawn new artists like Katie Pruitt, an up-and-coming songwriter and vocalist.\\nMichael Weintrob\\nWhile Fender may well help spawn new artists from the beginners taking its online lessons and buying its instruments in droves, Mooney said research revealed that \"90% of first-time players who pick up the guitar abandon it in the first year.\" But on the flip side of that sharp drop off, he added, the 10% who remain committed buy several more guitars. \"They have a lifetime value of $10,000,\" he calculated, \"and that\\'s a $1 billion bubble on top of sustainable, organic growth.\"\\nNo wonder Mooney is optimistic about not only Fender\\'s future, but that of the entire fretted instruments industry — which last year topped $8 billion, according to research organization Music Trades — that it dominates. \"I keep reminding people that we\\'re a growth company operating in a growth industry.\"\\nThe pandemic has changed the way people create and consume content and access entertainment.
